                        C++ programming is a high-level programming language that is widely used for developing a
                        variety of
                        software
                        applications. It is an extension of the C programming language and provides additional features
                        such
                        as object-oriented
                        programming (OOP) and support for generic programming. C++ offers a balance between low-level
                        programming control and
                        high-level language constructs, making it suitable for system-level programming as well as
                        application development.

                    <p>
                        C++ was created by <strong>Bjarne Stroustrup</strong>. He started developing the language in
                        1979 while working
                        at Bell Labs, with the
                        initial goal of enhancing the C programming language to support object-oriented programming.
                        Stroustrup added new
                        features and concepts to C, such as classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism, and the
                        resulting language was
                        named "C with Classes." In 1983, the language was renamed C++ to reflect its expanded
                        capabilities. Bjarne Stroustrup's
                        work on C++ has had a significant impact on the field of programming, and he is often referred
                        to as the creator or
                        founder of C++.

                        In C++, an object is an instance of a class. A class is a user-defined data type that
                        encapsulates data
                        and
                        functions
                        (known as member variables and member functions) into a single unit. When you create an object
                        of a
                        class,
                        you allocate
                        memory to hold the data members of the object and can use the member functions to operate on
                        that data.
                        Objects in C++ are used to represent real-world entities or concepts. They allow you to model
                        and
                        manipulate
                        data and
                        behavior in a structured manner. Each object has its own set of data members and can perform
                        operations
                        specific to its
                        class.
                    </p>
                    <strong>
                        Here's an example to illustrate the concept of objects in C++:
                    </strong>

                    <pre>
            #include < iostream>
            #include < string>
            class Degree {
            private:
            std::string name;
            std::string level;
            int duration;
            public:
            Degree(const std::string& degreeName, const std::string& degreeLevel, int degreeDuration) {
            name = degreeName;
            level = degreeLevel;
            duration = degreeDuration;
            }
            void displayInfo() {
            std::cout << "Name: " << name << std::endl; 
            std::cout << "Level: " << level << std::endl; std::cout
            << "Duration: " << duration << " years" << std::endl; }
             }; 
             int main() {
            Degree bachelor("Bachelor of Science", "Undergraduate" , 4); 
            Degree master("Master of Business Administration", "Postgraduate" , 2);
            Degree doctorate("Doctor of Philosophy", "Postgraduate" , 5); 
            bachelor.displayInfo(); 
            std::cout << std::endl; 
            master.displayInfo(); 
            std::cout << std::endl; 
            doctorate.displayInfo(); 
            return 0; }
                    </pre>

                    <p>
                        <strong>In the example above</strong>, the C++ object Degree represents an academic degree. It
                        has private member variables such as name, level, and duration
                        to store the attributes of a degree.

                        The Degree class has a constructor that takes the name, level, and duration of the degree as
                        parameters and initializes
                        the corresponding member variables. It also has a member function displayInfo() that prints the
                        information about the
                        degree.

                        In the main() function, we create instances of the Degree object, representing different degrees
                        such as a bachelor's
                        degree, master's degree, and doctorate. We pass the specific attributes of each degree when
                        creating the objects.
                        Finally, we call the displayInfo() function on each degree object to display their information.

                        This example demonstrates how a C++ object can be used to represent and manipulate data related
                        to academic degrees.
                        Each instance of the Degree object encapsulates the attributes of a specific degree and provides
                        methods to access and
                        display that information.

                        In C++, a pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. Pointers
                        allow you to indirectly
                        access and manipulate the data stored in memory. They are powerful and versatile tools used in
                        various programming
                        scenarios.
                    </p>
                    <strong>Here's a brief discussion on pointers in C++ with an example:</strong><br><br>
                    <strong>Declaration and Initialization:</strong>
                    <p>
                        To declare a pointer variable in C++, you use the asterisk (*) symbol before the variable name.
                        The syntax for declaring
                        a pointer is as follows:
                    </p>
                    <pre>
            dataType* pointerName;
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        For example, to declare a pointer to an integer named "ptr", you would write:
                    </p>
                    <pre>
            int* ptr;
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        To initialize a pointer, you can assign the address of another variable using the address-of
                        operator (&). For example:
                    </p>
                    <pre>
            int num = 5;
            int* ptr = & num;
                    </pre>
                    <strong>Dereferencing Pointers:</strong>
                    <p>
                        Dereferencing a pointer means accessing the value stored at the memory address it points to. You
                        use the dereference
                        operator (*) to access the value. For example:
                    </p>
                    <pre>
            int value = *ptr; // Accessing the value pointed to by ptr
                    </pre>
                    <strong>Pointer Arithmetic:</strong>
                    <p>
                        Pointers can be manipulated using arithmetic operations. You can increment or decrement a
                        pointer, which will make it
                        point to the next or previous memory location of the same data type. For example:
                    </p>
                    <pre>
            int* nextPtr = ptr + 1; // Points to the next memory location of the same data type
                    </pre>
                    <strong>Null Pointers:</strong>
                    <p>
                        A null pointer is a pointer that does not point to any valid memory address. You can assign a
                        null value to a pointer
                        using the keyword "nullptr". For example:
                    </p>
                    <pre>
            int* nullPtr = nullptr;
                    </pre>
                    <strong>Dynamic Memory Allocation:</strong>
                    <p>
                        Pointers are commonly used in dynamic memory allocation. You can allocate memory dynamically at
                        runtime using the "new"
                        keyword. For example:
                    </p>
                    <pre>
            int* dynamicPtr = new int;
            *dynamicPtr = 10;
                    </pre>
                    <strong>
                        It's important to properly deallocate dynamically allocated memory using the "delete"
                        keyword when it is no longer
                        needed. For example:
                    </strong>
                    <pre>
            delete dynamicPtr;
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        Pointers in C++ provide flexibility and efficiency in memory management and data manipulation.
                        They are extensively used
                        in scenarios such as working with arrays, creating data structures, implementing dynamic data
                        storage, and interacting
                        with functions that require passing variables by reference. However, it's crucial to use
                        pointers with care to avoid
                        potential issues like memory leaks or accessing invalid memory locations.

                        In C++, an array is a collection of elements of the same data type that are stored in contiguous
                        memory locations.
                        Arrays provide a way to store and access multiple values under a single variable name.
                    </p>
                    <strong>Here's a brief discussion on arrays in C++ with an example:</strong><br><br>
                    <strong>Declaration and Initialization:</strong>
                    <p>
                        To declare an array in C++, you need to specify the data type of the elements it will hold and
                        the number of elements it
                        can store. The syntax for declaring an array is as follows:
                    </p>
                    <pre>
            dataType arrayName[arraySize];
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        For example, to declare an array of integers named "numbers" with a size of 5, you would write:
                    </p>
                    <pre>
            int numbers[5];
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        You can also initialize the array elements at the time of declaration:
                    </p>
                    <pre>
            int numbers[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
                    </pre>
                    <strong>Accessing Array Elements:</strong>
                    <p>
                        Array elements can be accessed using their index. The index starts from 0 and goes up to
                        "arraySize - 1". To access an
                        element, you use the array name followed by the index inside square brackets. For example, to
                        access the second element
                        of the "numbers" array, you would write:
                    </p>
                    <pre>
            int secondNumber = numbers[1];
                    </pre>
                    <strong>Modifying Array Elements:</strong>
                    <p>
                        You can modify array elements by assigning new values to them using the assignment operator. For
                        example, to change the
                        value of the third element of the "numbers" array to 10, you would write:
                    </p>
                    <pre>
            numbers[2] = 10;
                    </pre>
                    <strong>Iterating Over an Array:</strong>
                    <p>
                        You can use loops, such as the "for" loop, to iterate over the elements of an array. The loop
                        variable can be used as
                        the index to access each element. For example, to print all the elements of the "numbers" array,
                        you can write:
                    </p>
                    <pre>
            for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) { 
                cout << numbers[i] << " " ;
            }
                    </pre>
                    <strong>Multi-dimensional Arrays:</strong>
                    <p>
                        C++ also supports multi-dimensional arrays, such as 2D arrays or matrices. These are arrays with
                        multiple rows and
                        columns. To declare and access elements in a 2D array, you use multiple indices. For example:
                    </p>
                    <pre>
            int matrix[3][3] = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}};
            int element = matrix[1][2]; // Accessing the element at row 1, column 2
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        Arrays in C++ provide a convenient way to store and manipulate collections of data. They are
                        widely used in various
                        programming scenarios, such as storing lists of values, implementing algorithms, and
                        representing matrices or tables.

                        Abstraction is an important concept in object-oriented programming, including C++. It refers to
                        the
                        process of
                        simplifying complex systems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable units. In C++,
                        abstraction is achieved
                        through the use of classes, objects, and interfaces, hiding the internal details and providing a
                        simplified view of the
                        system to the user.
                    </p>
                    <strong>Here are some basic terms and ideas related to abstraction in C++:</strong>
                    <p>
                        1. Class: A class is a blueprint or template that defines the structure and behavior of objects.
                        It
                        encapsulates data
                        members (attributes) and member functions (methods) that operate on the data. Classes provide
                        the
                        abstraction mechanism
                        in C++ by defining the properties and operations of objects.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2. Object: An object is an instance of a class. It represents a specific occurrence of the class
                        and
                        holds its own set
                        of data members and can perform operations defined by the class's member functions. Objects are
                        the
                        tangible entities
                        that interact with each other in a C++ program.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        3. Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the process of bundling data and the operations that
                        manipulate that
                        data together
                        within a class. It allows you to hide the internal implementation details of a class and provide
                        access
                        to the data
                        through well-defined interfaces. Encapsulation helps achieve information hiding and protects the
                        integrity of data by
                        controlling its access.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        4. Data Abstraction: Data abstraction focuses on providing only the essential information about
                        an
                        object to the outside
                        world, hiding the internal details. It allows you to define the characteristics and behaviors of
                        an
                        object without
                        revealing how they are implemented. Data abstraction is achieved through the use of classes,
                        where the
                        public interface
                        specifies the operations that can be performed on the object, while the private implementation
                        details
                        are hidden.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        5. Interface: An interface defines a set of methods that a class must implement. It specifies a
                        contract
                        or protocol for
                        how objects of a class should interact with the rest of the program. Interfaces allow you to
                        separate
                        the definition and
                        implementation of a class, promoting loose coupling and enhancing code maintainability.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        6. Modularity: Modularity is the division of a program into separate, self-contained modules or
                        units.
                        Abstraction helps
                        in achieving modularity by encapsulating related data and behavior within classes. Each class
                        represents
                        a module that
                        can be developed, tested, and maintained independently, contributing to code organization and
                        reusability.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        7. Inheritance and Polymorphism: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class to inherit
                        properties
                        (data and
                        functions) from another class. It promotes code reuse and supports hierarchical relationships
                        between
                        classes.
                        Polymorphism refers to the ability of objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a
                        common
                        base class,
                        allowing them to be used interchangeably. Inheritance and polymorphism are advanced concepts
                        that build
                        upon
                        abstraction, enabling more flexible and extensible designs.

                        Abstraction helps in managing the complexity of large software systems by providing clear
                        boundaries and
                        reducing
                        dependencies between components. It allows you to focus on the essential aspects of a system
                        while
                        hiding the
                        implementation details, making the code more maintainable, scalable, and reusable.

                        Encapsulation is a fundamental principle of object-oriented programming (OOP) that focuses on
                        bundling
                        data and the
                        operations that manipulate that data into a single unit. In C++, encapsulation is achieved using
                        classes, which serve as
                        containers for data members (attributes) and member functions (methods). The principle of
                        encapsulation
                        provides the
                    </p>
                    <strong>following basic terms and ideas:</strong>
                    <p>
                        1. Class: A class is a user-defined data type that encapsulates data members and member
                        functions into a
                        single entity.
                        It serves as a blueprint or template for creating objects. The class defines the structure and
                        behavior
                        of objects,
                        including their attributes and the operations that can be performed on those attributes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2. Data Members: Data members, also known as attributes or instance variables, are the variables
                        defined
                        within a class.
                        They represent the state or characteristics of an object. Data members are typically declared as
                        private
                        or protected to
                        restrict direct access from outside the class, enforcing encapsulation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        3. Member Functions: Member functions, also called methods, are functions defined within a class
                        that
                        operate on the
                        data members of objects. They represent the behavior or actions that objects can perform. Member
                        functions can be
                        public, private, or protected, determining their accessibility from outside the class.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        4. Access Specifiers: Access specifiers are keywords used to specify the visibility and
                        accessibility of
                        class members.
                        In C++, there are three access specifiers: public, private, and protected. They control the
                        level of
                        encapsulation and
                        determine which parts of the class are accessible to other parts of the program<br><br>
                        - Public: Public members are accessible from anywhere in the program. They define the interface
                        of the
                        class and can be
                        accessed by objects and external code<br><br>
                        - Private: Private members are accessible only within the class itself. They encapsulate the
                        internal
                        implementation
                        details and are not directly accessible outside the class. Private members can be accessed
                        through
                        public member
                        functions, providing controlled access to the class's data<br><br>
                        - Protected: Protected members are similar to private members, but they are also accessible in
                        derived
                        classes (class
                        inheritance will be covered in more advanced topics). Protected members provide a level of
                        encapsulation
                        and are used
                        when there is a need to share data and behavior among derived classes<br><br>
                        Encapsulation promotes information hiding, where the internal implementation details of a class
                        are
                        hidden from the
                        outside world. By making data members private and providing public member functions to access or
                        modify
                        them,
                        encapsulation ensures that the integrity and validity of the data are maintained<br><br>
                        <strong>This concept
                            provides
                            several
                            benefits, such as:
                        </strong><br><br>

                        - Modularity: Encapsulation allows you to divide a complex system into smaller,
                        self-contained
                        units
                        (classes),
                        promoting code modularity. Each class encapsulates its own data and behavior, making it
                        easier
                        to
                        understand, develop,
                        test, and maintain<br><br>

                        - Data Protection: Encapsulation protects data from direct manipulation by external code.
                        Access
                        to data
                        members is
                        controlled through member functions, allowing the class to enforce business rules,
                        validation,
                        and data
                        consistency<br><br>

                        - Code Flexibility: Encapsulation provides flexibility by allowing the internal
                        implementation
                        details
                        of a class to
                        change without affecting other parts of the program. As long as the public interface remains
                        the
                        same,
                        other code that
                        uses the class does not need to be modified<br><br>

                        - Code Reusability: Encapsulated classes can be reused in different programs or projects. By
                        providing a
                        well-defined
                        interface, classes can be utilized without understanding their internal details, promoting
                        code
                        reuse
                        and reducing
                        development time<br><br>

                        Encapsulation is a key principle in achieving robust and maintainable code in C++ and other
                        object-oriented programming
                        languages. It helps manage complexity, protect data, and promote modular and reusable

                        Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows classes to
                        inherit
                        properties and
                        behaviors from other classes. In C++, inheritance is implemented using the inheritance
                        mechanism, which
                        enables the
                        creation of new classes (derived classes) based on existing classes (base classes). Here are the
                        basic
                        terms and ideas
                        related to inheritance in C++:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        1. Base Class and Derived Class: In inheritance, the existing class is referred to as the base
                        class or
                        parent class.
                        The new class that inherits from the base class is called the derived class or child class. The
                        derived
                        class inherits
                        the properties (data members) and behaviors (member functions) of the base class<br><br>
                        2. Inheritance Types:
                        - Public Inheritance: In public inheritance, the public and protected members of the base class
                        become
                        public and
                        protected members of the derived class, respectively. Private members of the base class are not
                        accessible in the
                        derived class<br><br>
                        - Protected Inheritance: In protected inheritance, the public and protected members of the base
                        class
                        become protected
                        members of the derived class. Private members of the base class are not accessible in the
                        derived
                        class<br><br>
                        - Private Inheritance: In private inheritance, all members of the base class become private
                        members of
                        the derived
                        class. This means that the derived class can access the members of the base class, but they are
                        not
                        accessible from
                        outside the derived class<br><br>
                        The access specifier used during inheritance determines the accessibility of the base class
                        members in
                        the derived
                        class<br><br>
                        3. Derived Class Extension: The derived class can extend the functionality of the base class by
                        adding
                        its own
                        additional data members and member functions. It can also override the base class's member
                        functions to
                        provide its own
                        implementation. This allows customization and specialization of behavior based on the specific
                        needs of
                        the derived
                        class.<br><br>

                        4. Inherited Members: When a class is derived from another class, it inherits all the
                        non-private
                        members of the base
                        class, including data members, member functions, and nested classes. The derived class can
                        directly use
                        and access these
                        inherited members as if they were defined within the derived class itself.<br><br>

                        5. Access Specifiers and Inheritance:
                        - Public Inheritance: The public members of the base class remain public in the derived class,
                        and the
                        protected members
                        of the base class become protected members in the derived class.

                        - Protected Inheritance: Both public and protected members of the base class become protected
                        members in
                        the derived
                        class.<br><br>

                        - Private Inheritance: Both public and protected members of the base class become private
                        members in the
                        derived class.<br><br>

                        The choice of access specifier during inheritance determines the visibility and accessibility of
                        the
                        inherited members
                        in the derived class and its subclasses.<br><br>

                        6. Single Inheritance and Multiple Inheritance: C++ supports both single inheritance and
                        multiple
                        inheritance. Single
                        inheritance is when a derived class inherits from a single base class. Multiple inheritance is
                        when a
                        derived class
                        inherits from multiple base classes. Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit properties
                        and
                        behaviors from
                        multiple sources, but it requires careful consideration to avoid ambiguity and maintain code
                        clarity.<br><br>

                        Inheritance is a powerful mechanism in C++ that facilitates code reuse, promotes modularity, and
                        supports hierarchical
                        relationships between classes. It allows the creation of specialized classes based on existing
                        classes,
                        enabling the
                        implementation of more complex systems and achieving more flexible and extensible designs.

                        Polymorphism is a key concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows objects of
                        different
                        classes to be
                        treated as objects of a common base class. It enables the same interface (method or function) to
                        be
                        used
                        with objects of
                        different types, providing flexibility and extensibility in the code. In C++, polymorphism can
                        be
                        achieved through two
                        main mechanisms: function overloading and virtual functions.<br><br> <strong>Here are the basic
                            terms and ideas
                            related
                            to polymorphism
                            in C++:</strong>

                        1. Polymorphism: Polymorphism means "many forms." It refers to the ability of objects of
                        different
                        classes, derived from
                        a common base class, to be treated as objects of the base class. This allows a single interface
                        (method
                        or function) to
                        be used to perform different operations based on the actual type of the object at runtime.
                        <br><br>

                        2. Base Class and Derived Class: Polymorphism relies on inheritance. The base class is a common
                        class
                        that defines the
                        shared interface or behavior. The derived classes are the specialized classes that inherit from
                        the
                        base
                        class and
                        provide their own implementation of the shared interface.<br><br>

                        3. Function Overloading: Function overloading is a form of static (compile-time) polymorphism.
                        It
                        allows
                        multiple
                        functions with the same name but different parameters to be defined in the same scope. The
                        compiler
                        determines which
                        version of the function to call based on the number, type, and order of the arguments during the
                        function call.<br><br>

                        4. Virtual Functions: Virtual functions are a feature of dynamic (runtime) polymorphism in C++.
                        A
                        virtual function is a
                        member function declared in the base class with the "virtual" keyword. Derived classes can
                        override
                        the
                        virtual function
                        to provide their own implementation. When a virtual function is called using a pointer or
                        reference
                        to
                        the base class,
                        the actual implementation of the function is determined at runtime based on the type of the
                        object,
                        rather than the type
                        of the pointer or reference.<br><br>

                        5. Late Binding and Early Binding: Late binding and early binding are terms associated with
                        polymorphism
                        and virtual
                        functions. Late binding (also called dynamic binding or runtime binding) refers to the
                        determination
                        of
                        the appropriate
                        function implementation at runtime. It happens when a virtual function is called through a
                        pointer
                        <strong>or</strong>
                        reference to the
                        base class. Early binding (also called static binding or compile-time binding) refers to the
                        determination of the
                        appropriate function implementation at compile time. It occurs when a non-virtual function or a
                        function
                        call without a
                        pointer or reference is resolved during compilation.<br><br>

                        6. Pure Virtual Functions and Abstract Classes: A pure virtual function is a virtual function
                        declared
                        in the base class
                        with no implementation provided. <strong>It is declared using the syntax "virtual return_type
                            function_name() =

                        containing at least one pure virtual function is called an abstract class. Abstract classes

                        C is a widely used programming language that was developed in the early 1970s. It has had a
                        significant impact on the
                        field of computer programming and has influenced the development of many other
                        languages.<br><br>
                        <strong>
                            Here
                            is a review of some key
                            aspects of C:
                        </strong><br><br>
                        1. Simplicity: C is known for its simplicity and minimalistic design. It provides a small set of
                        keywords and
                        constructs, making it relatively easy to learn and understand. The language focuses on providing
                        low-level control over
                        hardware resources, making it suitable for systems programming and embedded systems.<br><br>

                        2. Efficiency: C is a compiled language that produces efficient machine code. It allows direct
                        manipulation of memory
                        and provides features such as pointers and bitwise operations, making it efficient for tasks
                        that require fine-grained
                        control over memory and performance.<br><br>

                        3. Portability: C was designed to be a portable language, meaning that C programs can be
                        compiled and run on different
                        platforms with minimal modifications. This portability is achieved by relying on a standardized
                        set of features and
                        libraries, known as the C standard library.<br><br>

                        4. Low-Level Features: C provides low-level features, such as direct memory access, pointer
                        arithmetic, and bitwise
                        operations. These features allow programmers to manipulate memory and hardware resources at a
                        fine-grained level, making
                        C suitable for tasks like device drivers, operating systems, and embedded systems
                        development.<br><br>

                        5. Structured Programming: C supports structured programming, which encourages the use of
                        modular code and control
                        structures like loops, conditionals, and functions. This promotes code readability,
                        maintainability, and reusability.<br><br>

                        6. Preprocessor Directives: C includes a preprocessor that allows for conditional compilation
                        and macro expansion.
                        Preprocessor directives, such as "#include" and "#define", provide flexibility in managing
                        dependencies and code
                        generation, although they can also introduce complexity and potential pitfalls if used
                        improperly.<br><br>

                        7. Lack of Built-in Abstractions: One notable characteristic of C is the absence of built-in
                        high-level abstractions,
                        such as classes, objects, and exception handling. While this provides flexibility, it requires
                        developers to implement
                        their own abstractions and error handling mechanisms.<br><br>

                        8. Weak Type Checking: C has a weak type checking system, which means that it allows implicit
                        conversions between
                        different types. While this flexibility can be useful, it also increases the risk of errors and
                        can make code harder to
                        understand and maintain.<br><br>

                        9. Memory Management: C requires manual memory management. Programmers need to explicitly
                        allocate and deallocate memory
                        using functions like "malloc" and "free". This manual memory management can be challenging and
                        error-prone, leading to
                        issues like memory leaks and buffer overflows if not handled carefully.<br><br>

                        10. Standard Library: C provides a standardized library, known as the C standard library, which
                        includes functions for
                        I/O, string manipulation, memory management, and other common operations. The standard library
                        provides a basic set of
                        functionalities, but it may lack some higher-level abstractions found in other
                        languages.<br><br>

                        Overall, C is a powerful and widely used programming language, particularly in systems
                        programming and situations where
                        low-level control and efficiency are essential. Its simplicity, efficiency, and portability make
                        it a popular choice for
                        various applications, although it does require careful attention to memory management and lacks
                        some higher-level
                        abstractions found in more modern languages.

                                C is primarily a procedural programming language, meaning it focuses on
                                writing functions and procedures.
                            </div>
                            <div class="col">
                                On the other hand, C++ supports both procedural programming and
                                object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigms. It allows
                                the use of classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism for better code organization
                                and reusability.
                            </div>
                            <div class="col">
                                C has a simple syntax, focusing on the procedural approach.
                            </div>
                            <div class="col">
                                C++ extends the C syntax by incorporating additional features for object-oriented
                                programming. It introduces new
                                keywords and syntax for class and object definitions, member functions, constructors,
                                destructors, and other OOP
                                concepts.

                            <div class="col">
                                C provides a limited standard library that includes basic functionalities like
                                input/output, string manipulation, and
                                mathematical functions.
                            </div>
                            <div class="col">
                                C++ has an extensive standard library that includes the entire C library and adds
                                additional features for file handling,
                                containers (e.g., vectors, lists), algorithms, and other utilities.
                            </div>
                            <div class="col">
                                In C, memory management is primarily manual. Programmers have to explicitly allocate and
                                deallocate memory using
                                functions like malloc() and free().
                            </div>
                            <div class="col">
                                C++ offers manual memory management through these functions as well, but it also
                                provides automatic memory management
                                using concepts like constructors, destructors, and the new and delete operators.
                                Additionally, C++ introduces smart
                                pointers and containers that handle memory management automatically, reducing the risk
                                of memory leaks.

                            <div class="col">
                                C does not have built-in support for exception handling. Error handling is typically
                                done using return codes or custom
                                error handling mechanisms.

                                C++, on the other hand, provides built-in exception handling using the try, catch, and
                                throw keywords. This allows for
                                more robust error handling and graceful program termination in case of exceptional
                                conditions.

                                C++ supports various object-oriented features such as function overloading, operator
                                overloading, inheritance,
                                polymorphism, encapsulation, and more. These features enable the creation of modular,
                                reusable, and extensible code,
                                making it easier to model real-world concepts and relationships.

                    <strong>Cin:-</strong>
                    <p>
                        In C++, the "cin" operator is used for input in the console. It is part of the iostream library
                        and is typically used to
                        read input from the user. The "cin" operator is used in conjunction with the extraction operator
                        (">>").
                    </p>
                    <strong>Here's an example of how "cin" can be used to read input from the user:</strong>
                    <pre>
                #include < iostream>
                int main() {
                int num;
                std::cout << "Enter a number: " ; std::cin>> num;
                std::cout << "You entered: " << num << std::endl; 
                return 0; }
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        In this example, the program prompts the user to enter a number. The "cin" operator is then used
                        to read the input
                        entered by the user and store it in the "num" variable. Finally, the program outputs the value
                        entered by the user.<br>
                        It's important to note that "cin" expects input to be formatted according to the data type of
                        the variable it is reading
                        into. If the user enters input of the wrong type, it can lead to errors or unexpected behavior.
                        It's a good practice to
                        validate the input to ensure it matches the expected format.

                    <strong>Cout:-</strong>
                    <p>
                        In C++, the "cout" operator is used for output in the console. It is part of the iostream
                        library and is typically used
                        to display or print information to the user. The "cout" operator is used in conjunction with the
                        insertion operator ("
                        <<"). </p>
                            <strong>Here's an example of how "cout" can be used to display output:</strong>
                            <pre>
                #include < iostream>
                int main() {
                int age = 25;
                std::cout << "My age is: " << age << std::endl; 
                std::cout << "This is a sentence." << std::endl; 
                return 0; }

                            </pre>
                            <p>
                                In this example, the program uses "cout" to output messages to the console. The
                                insertion operator ("<<") is used to insert the value of the "age" variable into the
                                    output stream. Multiple insertion operators can be used consecutively to display
                                    multiple values or concatenate strings. The "std::endl" manipulator is used to
                                    insert a newline character and flush the output stream.<br>
                                    <strong>The output of the above program would be:</strong>
                                    <br> My age is: 25 <br>This is a
                                    sentence.<br> By default, "cout" outputs the data in a formatted manner based on the
                                    data types being used. However, you
                                    can customize the formatting using manipulators and other techniques provided by the
                                    iostream library.<br> It's worth
                                    noting that "cout" is just one way to output information in C++. There are other
                                    stream objects available, such as
                                    "cerr" and "clog", which are used for error and log outputs, respectively.

                                In C++, the "new" operator is used to dynamically allocate memory for objects or arrays
                                during runtime. It is primarily
                                used for creating objects on the heap.
                                Here's an example of how the "new" operator can be used to dynamically allocate memory
                                for a single object:
                            </p>
                            <strong>int* p = new int; // Dynamically allocate memory for an integer</strong>
                            <p>
                                In this example, the "new" operator is used to allocate memory for an integer on the
                                heap. The result of the "new"
                                operator is a pointer to the allocated memory. The "int* p" declaration creates a
                                pointer "p" that can store the address
                                of an integer.
                                To allocate memory for an array of objects, you can use the "new" operator with square
                                brackets:
                                <strong>int* arr = new int[5]; // Dynamically allocate memory for an integer array of
                                    size 5

                                In this case, the "new" operator alloc
                            </p>

                                In C++, the "delete" operator is used to deallocate memory that was previously allocated
                                using the "new" operator. It is
                                used to free the memory and release the resources that were allocated dynamically.
                            </p>
                            <strong>
                                Here's an example of how the "delete" operator can be used to deallocate memory:

                            <strong>delete p; // Deallocate the memory</strong>
                            <p>
                                In this example, the "new" operator is used to allocate memory for an integer on the
                                heap, and the resulting pointer "p"
                                holds the address of the allocated memory. Later, when you're done using the dynamically
                                allocated memory, you use the
                                "delete" operator to deallocate it. This ensures that the memory is released and can be
                                reused.
                                Similarly, when you allocate memory for an array using "new[]", you need to use
                                "delete[]" to deallocate the memory:
                            </p>
                            <strong>int* arr = new int[5]; // Dynamically allocate memory for an integer array of size 5
                                //<br>
                                delete[] arr; // Deallocate the memory
                            </strong>
                            <p>
                                In this case, the "new[]" operator allocates memory for an array of five integers on the
                                heap, and the "delete[]"
                                operator is used to deallocate the memory when it is no longer needed.<br>
                                It's important to remember that whenever you use "new" or "new[]" to allocate memory,
                                you must use "delete" or
                                "delete[]", respectively, to deallocate the memory. Failing to deallocate the memory can
                                result in memory leaks and
                                inefficient memory usage.

                        Encapsulation in C++ is a fundamental principle of object-oriented programming (OOP) that
                        combines data and functions
                        into a single unit called a class. It allows the class to control the access to its data members
                        and provides a way to
                        hide the implementation details from the outside world.<br><br>
                        In C++, encapsulation is achieved by declaring the class's data members as private, and
                        providing public member
                        functions (also known as methods) to interact with and manipulate the data. The private data
                        members are only accessible
                        within the class, while the public member functions act as interfaces to access and modify the
                        private data.<br><br>
                        By encapsulating data and providing controlled access through member functions, encapsulation
                        offers several benefits:<br><br>
                        1. Data Hiding: Encapsulation hides the internal details of a class implementation from the
                        outside. Only the public
                        interface is exposed, providing abstraction and preventing direct manipulation of data, which
                        helps maintain the
                        integrity and consistency of the data.<br><br>
                        2. Access Control: Encapsulation allows you to control the access to class members. By declaring
                        data members as
                        private, you can enforce restrictions on how the data can be accessed, ensuring proper
                        validation and encapsulation of
                        the internal state.<br><br>
                        3. Modularity and Maintainability: Encapsulation helps in creating modular code. By
                        encapsulating related data and
                        operations into a single class, it promotes code organization and simplifies maintenance.
                        Changes to the internal
                        implementation of a class can be made without affecting the external code that uses the class,
                        as long as the public
                        interface remains the same.<br><br>
                        4. Code Reusability: Encapsulated classes can be used as building blocks to create larger
                        systems. By encapsulating
                        related functionality, you can reuse the class in different parts of the program or even in
                        different projects,
                        promoting code reuse and reducing development time.

                        the "speed" value. By encapsulating the "speed" data and providing public methods, the class ensures proper validation
                        and controlled access to the internal state. -->

                    </h5>
                    <p>
                        Information hiding is a principle of object-oriented programming (OOP) that is closely related
                        to encapsulation. It
                        emphasizes the idea of hiding the internal details of a class or module and exposing only what
                        is necessary for the
                        outside world to use. The goal is to provide a clear and well-defined interface while keeping
                        the implementation details
                        hidden and protected.<br><br>
                        In C++, information hiding is achieved through encapsulation. By declaring the data members of a
                        class as private, and
                        providing public member functions (methods) to access and manipulate those data members, you
                        establish a clear boundary
                        between the internal implementation and the external usage.<br><br>
                        <strong>The concept of information hiding has several benefits:</strong><br><br>
                        1. Abstraction: Information hiding allows you to present a simplified view of an object or
                        module to the outside world.
                        By hiding the internal details, you can focus on the essential features and behaviors that need
                        to be exposed, promoting
                        abstraction and reducing complexity.<br><br>
                        2. Modularity: Information hiding facilitates modular design. It allows you to encapsulate
                        related data and functions
                        into a single unit (class/module), making it easier to understand, test, and maintain. Changes
                        to the internal
                        implementation can be made without affecting the external code as long as the public interface
                        remains unchanged.<br><br>
                        3. Security and Data Integrity: Hiding the internal details of a class helps protect the
                        integrity of the data and
                        prevents unauthorized access. By controlling access through public methods, you can enforce
                        validation, apply business
                        rules, and ensure the consistency and correctness of the data.<br><br>
                        4. Code Maintenance and Evolution: Information hiding improves code maintainability and
                        evolution. The hidden
                        implementation details are shielded from external dependencies, allowing for easier
                        modifications and updates. The
                        internal implementation can be changed without affecting the external code, reducing the risk of
                        introducing bugs or
                        breaking existing functionality.<br><br>
                        In summary, information hiding, achieved through encapsulation, promotes encapsulating the
                        implementation details of a
                        class or module, exposing a well-defined interface, and providing the benefits of abstraction,
                        modularity, security, and
                        maintainability.

                        An abstract data type (ADT) in C++ is a concept in computer science and programming that refers
                        to a data type whose
                        behavior is defined by a set of operations, but not by its internal implementation. It provides
                        a high-level description
                        of how the data can be manipulated and what operations can be performed on it, without
                        specifying the details of how
                        those operations are implemented.<br><br>
                        ADTs are typically defined using classes in C++. The class serves as a blueprint for creating
                        objects that represent
                        instances of the ADT. The public interface of the class defines the operations that can be
                        performed on the data, while
                        the private implementation details are hidden from the user.<br><br>
                        The primary goal of an ADT is to provide a clear and well-defined abstraction of a data
                        structure or a collection of
                        data, enabling users to focus on what operations can be performed rather than how they are
                        implemented. This promotes
                        code modularity, reusability, and makes programs easier to understand and maintain.

                    <strong>Here's an example of an ADT called a Stack, which follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO)
                        principle:</strong>
                    <pre>
                 class Stack {
                 public:
                 virtual void push(int element) = 0;
                 virtual int pop() = 0;
                 virtual int top() = 0;
                 virtual bool isEmpty() = 0;
                 };
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        In this example, the "Stack" class defines a set of operations that can be performed on a stack,
                        such as "push", "pop",
                        "top", and "isEmpty". However, the class is declared as abstract using the "virtual" keyword and
                        pure virtual functions
                        ("= 0"), indicating that it cannot be instantiated directly. Instead, other classes can inherit
                        from this abstract class
                        and provide their own implementations for the pure virtual functions.<br><br>
                        By defining the ADT as an abstract class, the implementation details of the stack are left to
                        the derived classes,
                        allowing for different implementations based on specific requirements or performance
                        considerations. The users of the
                        ADT only need to know and use the defined operations without being concerned about how they are
                        implemented.<br><br>
                        In summary, an abstract data type in C++ is a data type that defines a set of operations without
                        specifying the internal
                        implementation details. It provides an abstraction and promotes code modularity, reusability,
                        and maintainability.

                    </h5>
                    <p>
                        In C++, objects and classes are fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming
                        (OOP).<br><br>
                        A class is a blueprint or a template that defines the structure and behavior of objects. It
                        encapsulates data (called
                        data members) and functions (called member functions or methods) that operate on that data. The
                        class serves as a
                        template for creating instances of objects, which are specific instances of the class.
                    </p>
                    <strong>Here's an example of a simple class in C++:</strong>
                    <pre>
                        class Rectangle {
                 private:
                 int width;
                 int height;
                 public:
                 void setDimensions(int w, int h) {
                 width = w;
                 height = h;
                 }
                 int calculateArea() {
                 return width * height;
                 }
                 };
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        In this example, the "Rectangle" class has two private data members ("width" and "height") to
                        represent the dimensions
                        of a rectangle. It also provides two member functions ("setDimensions" and "calculateArea") to
                        manipulate and retrieve
                        information about the rectangle.<br><br>
                        An object is an instance of a class. It is created based on the blueprint provided by the class.
                        Each object has its own
                        set of data members and can invoke the member functions defined in the class.
                    </p>
                    <strong>Here's an example of creating objects of the "Rectangle" class and using them:</strong>
                    <pre>
                 int main() {
                 Rectangle rect1; // Creating an object of the Rectangle class
                 rect1.setDimensions(5, 3); // Setting the dimensions of rect1
                 int area = rect1.calculateArea(); // Calculating the area of rect1
                 Rectangle rect2; // Creating another object of the Rectangle class
                 rect2.setDimensions(7, 2); // Setting the dimensions of rect2
                 int area2 = rect2.calculateArea(); // Calculating the area of rect2
                 return 0;
                 }
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        In this example, "rect1" and "rect2" are two objects of the "Rectangle" class. Each object has
                        its own set of data
                        members ("width" and "height") and can invoke the member functions ("setDimensions" and
                        "calculateArea") to manipulate
                        and retrieve information specific to that object.<br><br>
                        Objects in C++ allow you to create multiple instances of a class, each with its own state and
                        behavior. They enable you
                        to model and work with real-world entities or abstract concepts as self-contained units with
                        their own properties and
                        actions.<br><br>
                        By using classes and objects, you can organize your code into reusable and modular units,
                        allowing for better code
                        organization, encapsulation, and code reuse.

                    <p>
                        In C++, attributes refer to the characteristics or properties of an object or class. They
                        represent the data associated
                        with an object or class and provide information about its state or behavior.<br><br>
                        In object-oriented programming, attributes are typically implemented as data members within a
                        class. They define the
                        data that an object can store and manipulate. The attributes of a class are specified in the
                        class definition and can
                        have different data types, such as integers, floating-point numbers, characters, strings, or
                        even other objects.
                    </p>
                    <strong>Here's an example of a class with attributes (data members) in C++:</strong>
                    <pre>
                 class Person {
                 private:
                 std::string name;
                 int age;
                 public:
                 void setName(const std::string& n) {
                 name = n;
                 }
                 void setAge(int a) {
                 age = a;
                 }
                 std::string getName() const {
                 return name;
                 }
                 int getAge() const {
                 return age;
                 }
                        };
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        In this example, the "Person" class has two attributes: "name" and "age". The "name" attribute
                        represents the name of a
                        person and is of type "std::string", while the "age" attribute represents the age of the person
                        and is of type "int".
                        These attributes are declared as private, meaning they can only be accessed or modified through
                        member functions (such
                        as "setName", "setAge", "getName", and "getAge") defined within the class.<br><br>
                        Attributes provide the necessary data for objects to represent real-world entities or abstract
                        concepts. They
                        encapsulate the state of an object and allow objects to have unique values for their attributes,
                        which can be set or
                        retrieved using appropriate member functions. Attributes play a crucial role in defining the
                        characteristics and
                        behavior of objects and are an essential part of modeling data in C++ programs.

                    <p>
                        In C++, methods are member functions of a class that define the behavior or actions that objects
                        of the class can
                        perform. They are functions that are associated with a specific class and are used to manipulate
                        the data members of
                        that class or provide specific functionality.<br><br>
                        Methods are declared and defined within the class definition and can access the class's data
                        members and other member
                        functions. They can perform operations on the data, modify the state of the object, and provide
                        an interface for
                        interacting with the object's behavior.

                        In this example, the "Rectangle" class has two methods: "setDimensions" and "calculateArea". The
                        "setDimensions" method
                        takes two integer parameters "w" and "h" and sets the "width" and "height" data members of the
                        object. The
                        "calculateArea" method calculates and returns the area of the rectangle by multiplying the
                        "width" and "height".
                    </p>
                    <strong>To use these methods, you would create an object of the "Rectangle" class and invoke the

                    <p>
                        In this example, an object "rect" of the "Rectangle" class is created. The "setDimensions"
                        method is called on the
                        "rect" object to set its dimensions to 5 and 3. Then, the "calculateArea" method is called to
                        calculate the area of the
                        rectangle and store it in the "area" variable.<br><br>

                        In C++, class declaration is the process of defining the structure and member functions
                        (methods) of a class without
                        providing the implementation details. It serves as a blueprint or a template for creating
                        objects of that class.<br><br>
                        The declaration of a class typically includes the class name, data members (attributes), and
                        member function signatures
                        (prototypes). It provides information about the interface of the class, specifying what
                        operations can be performed on
                        objects of that class.

                        In this example, the "Rectangle" class is declared. It has two private data members ("width" and
                        "height") and two
                        member function prototypes ("setDimensions" and "calculateArea"). The private access specifier
                        indicates that the data
                        members are only accessible within the class, while the public access specifier indicates that
                        the member functions are
                        accessible from outside the class.<br><br>
                        The member function prototypes provide the signature of the functions, specifying the return
                        type, function name, and
                        parameters. The implementation details of these functions are not provided in the declaration;
                        they will be defined
                        separately.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After declaring a class, you can create objects of that class and define the member functions to
                        provide the
                        implementation details.
                    </p>
                    <strong>Here's an example of defining the member functions of the "Rectangle" class:</strong>
                    <pre>
                 void Rectangle::setDimensions(int w, int h) {
                 width = w;
                 height = h;
                 }                      
                 int Rectangle::calculateArea() {
                 return width * height;
                 }
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        In this example, the member functions "setDimensions" and "calculateArea" are defined outside
                        the class declaration
                        using the scope resolution operator ("::"). The implementation details of these functions
                        specify how the operations
                        should be performed.<br><br>
                        Class declarations in C++ allow you to define the structure and interface of a class separately
                        from its implementation.
                        This promotes code modularity, encapsulation, and reusability, as other parts of the program can
                        use the declared class
                        without being concerned about the implementation details.
                    </p>
                    <strong>State identify and behavior of an object:-</strong>
                    <p>
                        In C++, an object is an instance of a class. It encapsulates data and behavior together. Let's
                        go through the steps to
                        define, identify, and interact with an object in C++.
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                 1. Define a class:
                 class MyClass {
                 private:
                 int myNumber;
                 string myText;
                 public:
                 void setNumber(int number) {
                 myNumber = number;
                 }
                 void setText(const string& text) {
                 myText = text;
                 }                      
                 void print() {
                 cout << "Number: " << myNumber << endl; cout << "Text: " << myText << endl; } }; 
                 2. Create an object: 
                 MyClass myObject;
                 3. Identify the object: 
                 In C++, you can use the object's name directly to identify it. For example, "myObject". 
                 4. Access and modify object's data: myObject.setNumber(42); myObject.setText("Hello, World!"); 
                 5. Invoke object's behavior: myObject.print();
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        The "print()" function defined in the class will be called, displaying the object's data:
                        Number: 42
                        Text: Hello, World!<br><br>
                        So, in this example, the object "myObject" of type "MyClass" is identified by its name and
                        behaves by calling its member
                        functions ("setNumber", "setText", and "print") to manipulate and display its data.<br><br>
                        Note that in practice, it is common to use constructors and access modifiers (like "private" and
                        "public") to define the
                        behavior and control the access to the object's data. This example provides a basic illustration
                        of object
                        identification and behavior in C++.

                        Constructors and destructors are special member functions in C++ that are used to initialize and
                        clean up the objects of
                        a class, respectively. They are automatically called when objects are created or destroyed.
                    </p>
                    <strong>1. Constructors:</strong>
                    <p>
                        Constructors are member functions that are invoked automatically when an object of a class is
                        created. Their purpose is
                        to initialize the object's data members and set up its initial state. Constructors have the same
                        name as the class and
                        do not have a return type, not even "void".
                    </p>
                    <strong>
                        There are several types of constructors:<br><br>
                        a. Default Constructor:
                    </strong>
                    <p>
                        A default constructor is a constructor that takes no arguments. It is used to create objects
                        without providing any
                        initial values explicitly.
                    </p>
                    <strong>b. Parameterized Constructor:</strong>
                    <p>
                        A parameterized constructor is a constructor that takes one or more parameters. It allows you to
                        provide initial values
                        to the object's data members at the time of object creation.
                    </p>
                    <strong>c. Copy Constructor:</strong>
                    <p>
                        A copy constructor is a constructor that creates a new object by copying the values of another
                        object of the same class.
                        It is invoked when a new object is initialized using an existing object.
                    </p>
                    <strong>Here's an example of a class with different types of constructors:</strong>

                    </pre>
                    <strong>2. Destructors:</strong>
                    <p>
                        Destructors are member functions that are automatically called when an object is about to be
                        destroyed or goes out of
                        scope. They are used to release resources, perform cleanup tasks, or deallocate memory that was
                        allocated by the object.
                        The destructor has the same name as the class, preceded by a tilde (~). It does not take any
                        arguments and does not have
                        a return type, not even "void".
                    </p>
                    <pre>

                        in the above ex...........................
                    </p>
                    It's important to note that if you don't define a destructor explicitly, the compiler generates a
                    default destructor for
                    you. However, if your class manages resources that need cleanup (e.g., dynamically allocated
                    memory), it's often
                    necessary to provide a custom destructor to ensure proper cleanup.<br><br>
                    <strong>
                        NOTE:- "Constructors and destructors play a crucial role in managing the lifecycle of objects,
                        allowing proper initialization and cleanup operations as needed."

                        Instantiation of objects in C++ refers to the process of creating instances or individual
                        objects of a class. When you
                        instantiate an object, you allocate memory for it and initialize its data members using a
                        constructor. It allows you to
                        create multiple independent objects that have their own distinct data.<br><br>
                        To instantiate an object in C++, you follow these steps:
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                 1. Define a class:
                 class MyClass {
                 private:
                 int myNumber;
                 string myText;
                 public:
                 MyClass(int number, const string& text) {
                 myNumber = number;
                 myText = text;
                 }
                 void print() {
                 cout << "Number: " << myNumber << endl; cout << "Text: " << myText << endl; } }; 
                 2. Create an object instance: 
                 MyClass obj(42, "Hello, World!" );
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        The above code creates an object "obj" of the class "MyClass". It calls the constructor
                        "MyClass(int, const string&)" to
                        initialize the object with the provided values.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        3. Interact with the object:
                        You can now access the object's data members and invoke its member functions.
                        obj.print();
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The "print()" function defined in the class is invoked on the "obj" object, displaying its
                        data:<br><br>
                        Number: 42<br>
                        Text: Hello, World!<br><br>
                        "You can create multiple objects of the same class, each with its own data and behavior. Each
                        object instance is
                        independent of others and can be manipulated separately."
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                 MyClass obj1(10, "Object 1");
                 MyClass obj2(20, "Object 2");
                 
                 obj1.print(); // Number: 10, Text: Object 1
                 obj2.print(); // Number: 20, Text: Object 2
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        In this example, two objects "obj1" and "obj2" are instantiated from the "MyClass" class. Each
                        object holds its specific
                        data and can be operated on separately.<br>
                        Instantiating objects allows you to create multiple instances of a class, enabling you to work
                        with individual objects
                        and utilize the encapsulated data and behavior defined within the class.

                    <h5>
                        <strong>Default parameter value:-</strong>
                    </h5>
                    <p>
                        In C++, you can specify default parameter values for function parameters. A default parameter
                        value is a value that is
                        automatically used if no argument is provided for that parameter when calling the function. It
                        allows you to define
                        functions with flexible behavior, as the default values provide a fallback option when specific
                        arguments are not
                        provided.
                    </p>
                    <strong>Here's the syntax for specifying default parameter values:</strong>
                    <pre>
                 return_type function_name(parameter_type parameter_name = default_value);
                 
                 Let's see an example:
                 
                 #include < iostream>
                 void printMessage(const std::string& message = "Hello, World!") {
                 std::cout << message << std::endl; } 
                 int main() { 
                 printMessage(); // Uses the default value "Hello, World!"
                 printMessage("Custom message"); // Uses the provided argument "Custom message" 
                 return 0; }
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        In the above code, the "printMessage()" function has a default parameter value for the "message"
                        parameter, which is set
                        to ""Hello, World!"". If no argument is provided when calling the function, it uses the default
                        value. However, you can
                        also pass a different message as an argument, and it will override the default value.<br><br>
                        Output:<br>
                        Hello, World!<br>
                        Custom message<br><br>
                        Note:- That default parameter values are typically specified in the function declaration (header
                        file), while the function
                        definition (implementation) usually does not include the default values. This is to ensure
                        consistency across different
                        translation units (source files) that may include the header file.
                    </p>
                    <strong>
                        You can also have multiple parameters with default values in a function, allowing you to
                        selectively override specific
                        parameters while using the default values for the rest.

                        In this example, the "printNumbers()" function has three parameters with default values. You can
                        choose to provide
                        values for any subset of the parameters while relying on the default values for the rest.
                        Attempting to provide more
                        arguments than there are parameters in the function declaration will result in a compilation
                        error.<br><br>
                        Default parameter values offer flexibility when calling functions by allowing you to omit
                        certain arguments while still
                        providing sensible default values.

                    <p>
                        In C++, objects can have different types based on the class they are instantiated from. The type
                        of an object determines
                        the set of operations that can be performed on it and how it behaves. Here are some common
                        object types in C++:
                    </p>
                    <strong>1. Built-in Types:</strong>
                    <p>
                        C++ provides several built-in types, such as "int", "float", "char", "bool", etc. Objects of
                        these types are
                        instantiated directly without the need for a class definition.
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                 Example:
                 int num = 42;
                 float value = 3.14;
                 char letter = 'A';
                    </pre>
                    <strong>2. Standard Library Types:</strong>
                    <p>
                        The C++ Standard Library provides various types and containers, such as "std::string",
                        "std::vector", "std::map", etc.
                        Objects of these types are instantiated from the standard library classes.
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                 Example:
                 std::string text = "Hello, World!";
                 std::vector< int> numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
                 std::map<std::string, int> scores = {{"Alice", 90}, {"Bob", 85}};
                    </pre>
                    <strong>3. User-Defined Types:</strong>
                    <p>
                        User-defined types are created by defining a class or struct. Objects of these types are
                        instantiated from the defined
                        classes or structs.
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                 Example:
                 class MyClass {
                 private:
                 int myNumber;
                 std::string myText;
                 
                 public:
                 // Constructor
                 MyClass(int number, const std::string& text) {
                 myNumber = number;
                 myText = text;
                 }
                 };
                 // Instantiate an object of MyClass
                 MyClass obj(42, "Hello");
                    </pre>
                    <strong>4. Derived Types:</strong>
                    <p>
                        In object-oriented programming, you can create derived classes or subclasses that inherit
                        properties and behavior from a
                        base class. Objects of derived classes can be instantiated and have both the type of the derived
                        class and the type of
                        the base class.
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                 Example:
                 class Animal {
                 public:
                 void sound() {
                 std::cout << "Animal makes a sound." << std::endl; 
                 } 
                 }; 
                 class Dog : public Animal {
                 public: 
                 void sound() {
                 std::cout<< "Dog barks." << std::endl; 
                 } 
                 }; 
                 // Instantiate objects of both base and derived classes 
                 Animal animal; 
                 Dog dog;
                 animal.sound(); // "Animal makes a sound." 
                 dog.sound(); // "Dog barks."
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        In C++, objects can have different types depending on the class they are instantiated from. The
                        type determines the
                        available operations and behaviors associated with the object, allowing for a flexible and
                        polymorphic programming
                        approach.

                        C++ does not have built-in automatic garbage collection like some other programming languages
                        (e.g., Java or C#). In
                        C++, memory management is typically done manually by the programmer using the concepts of
                        dynamic memory allocation and
                        deallocation.<br><br>
                        C++ uses a combination of stack-based and heap-based memory management:
                    </p>
                    <strong>1. Stack Allocation:</strong>
                    <p>
                        Variables declared within a function or a block are typically allocated on the stack. Memory for
                        these variables is
                        automatically allocated when the program enters the scope and automatically deallocated when the
                        scope is exited. The
                        stack is managed by the compiler and follows a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) approach.
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                 Example:
                 void foo() {
                 int x = 10; // x is allocated on the stack
                 // ...
                 }
                    </pre>
                    <strong>2. Heap Allocation:</strong>
                    <p>
                        Memory allocation on the heap, also known as dynamic memory allocation, is done using operators
                        like "new" and "delete"
                        or "new[]" and "delete[]". The programmer explicitly requests memory from the heap and is
                        responsible for deallocating
                        it when it is no longer needed. If deallocation is not done correctly, it can lead to memory
                        leaks.
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                 Example:
                 void bar() {
                 int* y = new int; // Allocate memory on the heap
                 // ...
                 delete y; // Release the allocated memory
                 }
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        To manage dynamic memory effectively and avoid memory leaks or dangling pointers, it is common
                        practice to use smart
                        pointers or RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) techniques in C++. Smart pointers like
                        "std::shared_ptr",
                        "std::unique_ptr", and "std::weak_ptr" provide automatic memory management and help prevent
                        common memory-related
                        issues.<br><br>
                        C++ also provides libraries and frameworks that offer garbage collection-like functionality. For
                        example, the Boehm
                        garbage collector (libgc) is a popular third-party library that can be used with C++ to provide
                        automatic garbage
                        collection capabilities.<br><br>
                        It's important to note that manual memory management in C++ gives developers more control over
                        resource allocation and
                        deallocation, but it also requires careful handling to ensure efficient memory usage and prevent
                        memory-related issues.

                        <strong>Dynamic memory allocation:-</strong>
                    </h5>
                    <p>
                        Dynamic memory allocation in C++ allows you to allocate and manage memory at runtime. It enables
                        you to create objects
                        of variable size and lifetime, and it is commonly used when you need to allocate memory for
                        objects whose size is
                        unknown at compile time or when you want to explicitly control the lifetime of an
                        object.<br><br>
                        In C++, dynamic memory allocation is performed using the "new" and "delete" operators for single
                        objects, and the
                        "new[]" and "delete[]" operators for arrays.
                    </p>
                    <strong>1. Allocating a Single Object:</strong>
                    <pre>
                 // Allocate memory for a single integer
                 int* ptr = new int;
                 *ptr = 42;                     
                 // Use the allocated memory
                 std::cout << *ptr << std::endl; 
                 // Deallocate the memory 
                 delete ptr;
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        In the above example, "new int" allocates memory for a single integer on the heap. The allocated
                        memory is accessed
                        using the pointer "ptr", and the value is set to 42. Finally, "delete ptr" deallocates the
                        memory when it is no longer
                        needed.
                    </p>
                    <strong>2. Allocating an Array:</strong>
                    <pre>
                 // Allocate memory for an array of integers
                 int* arr = new int[5];
                 // Initialize the array elements
                 for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                 arr[i]=i; } 
                 // Use the allocated array 
                 for (int i=0; i < 5; i++) {
                 std::cout << arr[i]<< " " ; 
                 } 
                 std::cout << std::endl; 
                 // Deallocate the array memory 
                 delete[] arr;
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        Here, "new int[5]" allocates memory for an array of five integers on the heap. The array
                        elements are accessed using the
                        pointer "arr", and the array is initialized and used. Finally, "delete[] arr" deallocates the
                        array memory.<br><br>
                        It's important to note that memory allocated using "new" or "new[]" must be explicitly
                        deallocated using "delete" or
                        "delete[]" to prevent memory leaks. Failure to deallocate the memory results in memory leaks,
                        where memory remains
                        allocated even when it is no longer needed.<br><br>
                        Additionally, C++ provides smart pointers ("std::shared_ptr", "std::unique_ptr",
                        "std::weak_ptr") and standard library
                        containers ("std::vector", "std::string", etc.) that manage memory automatically, making memory
                        management safer and
                        more convenient.
                        When using dynamic memory allocation, it's crucial to ensure proper memory management to prevent
                        memory leaks, access
                        violations, or undefined behavior.

                    <p>
                        An abstract class in C++ is a class that is designed to be a base class for other classes. It
                        cannot be instantiated on
                        its own, but it provides a common interface and defines virtual functions that derived classes
                        must implement. An
                        abstract class is often used to create a common interface for a group of related
                        classes.<br><br>
                        To create an abstract class in C++, you declare one or more pure virtual functions by adding the
                        "virtual" keyword and
                        setting them to "0". A pure virtual function is a function that has no implementation in the
                        base class.
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                 Example:
                 class AbstractClass {
                 public:
                 virtual void pureVirtualFunction() = 0;                       
                 // Other member functions...
                 };
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        Any class that inherits from an abstract class must implement all the pure virtual functions. If
                        a derived class does
                        not implement all the pure virtual functions, it becomes an abstract class as well.
                    </p>
                    <strong>2. Meta Class:</strong>
                    <p>
                        The concept of "meta classes" is not part of the C++ language itself. However, you can use
                        various techniques and
                        libraries in C++ to achieve metaprogramming, which allows you to perform compile-time
                        computations, generate code, and
                        manipulate types at compile-time.<br><br>
                        Metaprogramming in C++ is typically achieved using template metaprogramming techniques, where
                        templates are used to
                        perform computations and generate code during the compilation process. The C++ Standard Library
                        also provides utilities
                        like "std::type_info" and "std::type_traits" that allow runtime type information and type
                        manipulation.
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                 Example (template metaprogramming):
                 template < typename T>
                 struct MetaClass {
                 // MetaClass implementation...
                 };
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        In the above example, "MetaClass" is a template struct that can be used for metaprogramming
                        purposes. You can specialize
                        the template for different types to perform different operations or generate code based on the
                        type.<br><br>
                        Note:- The actual functionalities and techniques used for metaprogramming in C++ can be quite
                        complex and advanced.
                        They often involve template specialization, template metaprogramming techniques, constexpr
                        functions, type traits, and
                        advanced template features like variadic templates.<br><br>
                        In summary, while C++ does not have direct concepts of "meta classes" or "abstract classes," you
                        can achieve similar
                        functionality using abstract classes and virtual functions for abstraction and interfaces, and
                        template metaprogramming
                        techniques for compile-time computations and code generation.

                        Inheritance is a fundamental feature of object-oriented programming that allows you to define a
                        new class (called the
                        derived class) based on an existing class (called the base class). In C++, inheritance is used
                        to establish
                        relationships between classes, promote code reuse, and create class hierarchies.<br><br>
                        To create a derived class from a base class, you use the "class" or "struct" keyword followed by
                        the name of the derived
                        class, a colon, and the access specifier indicating the type of inheritance (public, protected,
                        or private).<br><br>
                        The derived class can access the public and protected members of the base class, while the
                        private members of the base class remain inaccessible to the derived class.

                    <p>
                        Derived classes can override base class member functions by providing their own implementation

                        signature. This is known as function overriding. In C++, you use the "virtual" keyword to enable
                        dynamic dispatch and
                        allow polymorphic behavior.
                    </p>
                    <pre>

                        Inheritance in C++ allows you to create class hierarchies and take advantage of polymorphism,
                        code reuse, and
                        abstraction. It is an essential mechanism for building complex object-oriented systems.

                        <strong>Class hierarchy:-</strong>

                    <p>
                        In C++, class hierarchy refers to the organization of classes into a hierarchical structure,
                        where classes are arranged
                        in a parent-child relationship. The parent class is called the base class or superclass, and
                        the child class is called
                        the derived class or subclass. This hierarchy allows for code reuse, polymorphism, and
                        abstraction.
                    </p>
                    <strong>Here's an example of a simple class hierarchy in C++:</strong>
                    <pre>
                 class Shape {
                 public:
                 virtual void draw() {
                 // Base class implementation
                 }
                 };
                 
                 class Circle : public Shape {
                 public:
                 void draw() override {
                 // Circle-specific implementation
                 }
                 };
                 
                 class Square : public Shape {
                 public:
                 void draw() override {
                 // Square-specific implementation
                 }
                 };
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        In the above example, "Shape" is the base class, and "Circle" and "Square" are derived
                        classes. Both "Circle" and
                        "Square" inherit from "Shape". Each class in the hierarchy can override the "draw()"
                        function to provide its own
                        implementation.
                    </p>
                    <strong>
                        This class hierarchy allows you to treat objects of derived classes as objects of the base
                        class, enabling polymorphism.
                        For example:
                    </strong>
                    <pre>
                 void drawShape(Shape* shape) {
                 shape->draw(); // Calls the appropriate draw() implementation
                 }
                 
                 int main() {
                 Circle circle;
                 Square square;
                 
                 drawShape(&circle); // Calls the draw() function of Circle
                 drawShape(&square); // Calls the draw() function of Square
                 
                 return 0;
                 }
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        In the above "main()" function, the "drawShape()" function takes a pointer to a "Shape"
                        object. When called with a
                        "Circle" object or a "Square" object, it calls the appropriate "draw()" function based on
                        the actual type of the object,
                        thanks to dynamic dispatch and polymorphism.<br><br>
                        Class hierarchies can be more complex and can include multiple levels of inheritance, with
                        classes inheriting from other
                        derived classes. You can create specialized behavior in derived classes while still
                        benefiting from the common
                        functionality provided by the base class.<br><br>
                        Class hierarchies are a powerful tool in object-oriented programming for organizing and
                        structuring code, promoting code
                        reuse, and enabling polymorphism and abstraction. They allow you to model relationships
                        between different types of
                        objects and build complex systems.

                        In C++, derivation refers to the process of creating a new class (derived class or subclass)
                        from an existing class
                        (base class or superclass). The derived class inherits the properties (data members) and
                        behaviors (member functions) of
                        the base class, allowing for code reuse and the extension of functionality.<br><br>

                        Derived classes can access and use the public and protected members of the base class, including
                        data members and member
                        functions. They can also override base class member functions by providing their own
                        implementation using the same
                        function signature. This is known as function overriding.<br><br>
                        In addition to inheriting from a single base class, C++ supports multiple inheritance, where a
                        derived class can inherit
                        from multiple base classes. This allows for the creation of more complex class hierarchies and
                        the combination of
                        functionality from multiple sources.<br><br>
                        It's important to note that access specifiers control the visibility and accessibility of
                        inherited members in the
                        derived class, affecting how they can be accessed within the derived class and from outside.
                        Public inheritance is the
                        most common type and preserves the original access level of the base class members in the
                        derived class.<br><br>
                        Derivations in C++ provide a powerful mechanism for building class hierarchies, enabling code
                        reuse, and implementing
                        concepts like polymorphism, abstraction, and specialization. They are a fundamental part of
                        object-oriented programming
                        and allow for flexible and extensible design.

                        <strong>Aggregation:-</strong>
                    </h5>
                    <p>
                        Aggregation is a type of association between classes in C++ where one class has a relationship
                        with another class by
                        maintaining a reference or pointer to an object of another class. It represents a "has-a"
                        relationship, where an object
                        of one class "has" or "contains" objects of another class as its members.<br><br>
                        In aggregation, the lifetime of the associated objects is independent of the container object.
                        The associated objects
                        can exist outside the scope of the container object, and multiple container objects can share
                        the same associated
                        object.<br><br>
                        Aggregation is typically implemented using member variables of the container class that are
                        instances or
                        pointers/references to the associated class. The associated class can be a concrete class or
                        another class hierarchy.
                    </p>
                    <strong>Here's an example of aggregation in C++:</strong>
                    <pre>
                 class Address {
                 std::string street;
                 std::string city;
                 std::string state;
                 public:
                 Address(const std::string& s, const std::string& c, const std::string& st)
                 : street(s), city(c), state(st) {}
                 };
                 
                 class Person {
                 std::string name;
                 int age;
                 Address* address; // Aggregation using a pointer
                 public:
                 Person(const std::string& n, int a, Address* addr)
                 : name(n), age(a), address(addr) {}
                 };
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        In the above example, the "Person" class aggregates the "Address" class using a pointer
                        "address". Each "Person" object
                        can have an associated "Address" object, but the "Address" object can exist independently
                        outside the "Person" object.<br><br>
                        Aggregation allows objects to be composed together to form a more complex structure. It is
                        useful when you want to
                        represent relationships where one object is composed of or contains other objects, but the
                        associated objects have their
                        own lifecycle and can be shared among multiple container objects.<br><br>
                        It's important to note that in aggregation, the container object is responsible for managing the
                        associated object's
                        lifetime, including its creation, deletion, and any necessary cleanup.<br><br>
                        Aggregation is a form of object composition and is one of the key concepts in object-oriented
                        programming for building
                        complex systems with relationships between objects.

                        In C++, the terms "composition" and "classification" are not commonly used to describe different

                        class hierarchies: composition
                        and inheritance. Let's discuss these two concepts:
                    </strong>
                    <strong>1. Composition:</strong>
                    <p>
                        Composition is a relationship between classes where one class contains an instance of another
                        class as a member
                        variable. It represents a "has-a" relationship, where an object of one class is composed of or
                        contains objects of other
                        classes. Composition implies ownership and responsibility for the lifetime of the composed
                        objects.<br><br>
                        In composition, the lifetime of the composed objects is tightly coupled to the lifetime of the
                        container object. When
                        the container object is destroyed, the composed objects are also destroyed. Composition allows
                        creating complex objects
                        by combining simpler objects or components.
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                 Example:
                 class Engine {
                 // Engine class implementation
                 };
                 
                 class Car {
                 Engine engine; // Composition
                 // Other member variables and functions
                 };
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        In the above example, the "Car" class has a composition relationship with the "Engine" class.
                        Each "Car" object contains
                        an "Engine" object as a member variable.
                    </p>
                    <strong>2. Inheritance:</strong>
                    <p>
                        Inheritance is a mechanism for creating class hierarchies where a derived class inherits
                        properties and behaviors from a
                        base class. It represents an "is-a" relationship, where a derived class is a specialized version
                        of the base class.
                        Inheritance promotes code reuse, polymorphism, and abstraction.<br><br>
                        In inheritance, the derived class extends and specializes the functionality of the base class.
                        It inherits the members
                        (data members and member functions) of the base class and can override or add new members. The
                        lifetime of derived
                        objects is independent of the base class.
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                 Example:
                 class Animal {
                 // Animal class implementation
                 };
                 
                 class Dog : public Animal {
                 // Dog class extends Animal class
                 };
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        In the above example, the "Dog" class inherits from the "Animal" class. The "Dog" class is a
                        specialized version of the
                        "Animal" class and can access and override the members of the "Animal" class.<br><br>
                        These are the commonly used concepts in C++ for building class hierarchies. If there are
                        specific concepts or

                        Polymorphism is a key concept in object-oriented programming that allows objects of different
                        types to be treated as
                        objects of a common base type. It enables code to be written that can work with objects of
                        multiple derived classes
                        through a common interface.

                        <strong>In C++, polymorphism is primarily achieved through two mechanisms:</strong>
                    </h5>
                    <strong>1. Virtual Functions:</strong>
                    <p>
                        Polymorphism is commonly implemented using virtual functions. A virtual function is a member
                        function in the base class
                        that is declared with the "virtual" keyword and is intended to be overridden by derived classes.
                        When a derived class
                        overrides a virtual function, it provides its own implementation of that function.
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                 Example:
                 class Shape {
                 public:
                 virtual void draw() {
                 // Base class implementation
                 }
                 };
                 
                 class Circle : public Shape {
                 public:
                 void draw() override {
                 // Circle-specific implementation
                 }
                 };
                 
                 class Square : public Shape {
                 public:
                 void draw() override {
                 // Square-specific implementation
                 }
                 };
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        In the above example, the "draw()" function is declared as a virtual function in the base class
                        "Shape". The derived
                        classes "Circle" and "Square" override the "draw()" function with their own specific
                        implementations.<br><br>
                        Polymorphism is achieved when objects of derived classes are accessed through pointers or
                        references of the base class
                        type. The appropriate version of the overridden function is called at runtime based on the
                        actual type of the object.
                    </p>

                 void drawShape(Shape* shape) {

                    <p>
                        Polymorphism can also be achieved through abstract base classes or interfaces. An abstract base
                        class is a class that
                        declares one or more pure virtual functions. A pure virtual function is declared using the
                        "virtual" keyword and "= 0"
                        syntax, indicating that it has no implementation in the base class and must be overridden by any
                        derived class.
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                 Example:
                 class Shape {
                 public:
                 virtual void draw() = 0; // Pure virtual function
                 };
                 
                 class Circle : public Shape {
                 public:
                 void draw() override {
                 // Circle-specific implementation
                 }
                 };
                 
                 class Square : public Shape {
                 public:
                 void draw() override {
                 // Square-specific implementation
                 }
                 };
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        In this example, the "Shape" class is an abstract base class with a pure virtual function
                        "draw()". The derived classes
                        "Circle" and "Square" override the "draw()" function with their specific
                        implementations.<br><br>
                        Abstract base classes cannot be instantiated directly, but pointers or references of the
                        abstract base class type can be
                        used to hold objects of derived classes. This allows polymorphic behavior, where different
                        derived objects can be
                        accessed and manipulated through a common interface.
                    </p>
                    <pre>

                 shape->draw(); // Calls the appropriate draw() implementation
                 }
                 
                 int main() {
                 Circle circle;
                 Square square;
                 
                 drawShape(&circle); // Calls the draw() function of Circle
                 drawShape(&square); // Calls the draw() function of Square
                 
                 return 0;
                 }

                    <p>
                        Polymorphism provides a powerful mechanism for writing flexible and reusable code by treating
                        objects of different types
                        in a uniform way. It allows for code extensibility, promotes code modularity, and enables the
                        implementation.

                    <strong>
                        In C++, there are primarily two categorizations of polymorphic techniques:
                        <br><br>
                        1. Compile-Time Polymorphism (Static Polymorphism):
                    </strong>
                    <p>
                        Compile-time polymorphism refers to polymorphic behavior that is resolved during the
                        compilation phase based on the
                        types of objects involved. It is also known as static polymorphism or early binding.
                        Compile-time polymorphism in C++ is achieved through function overloading and template
                        specialization.<br><br>
                        <strong>a. Function Overloading:</strong>
                        Function overloading allows multiple functions with the same name but different parameters
                        to be defined. The
                        appropriate function to be called is determined by the types and number of arguments at
                        compile-time.

                    <pre>

                 int intValue = 10;
                 double doubleValue = 3.14;

                    <strong>b. Template Specialization:</strong>
                    <p>
                        Templates in C++ allow writing generic code that can be instantiated for different types at
                        compile-time. Template
                        specialization allows providing specialized implementations for specific types.

                    <p>
                        Runtime polymorphism refers to polymorphic behavior that is resolved during the runtime based on
                        the actual type of
                        objects. It is also known as dynamic polymorphism or late binding.<br><br>
                        Runtime polymorphism in C++ is achieved through virtual functions and inheritance.<br><br>
                        <strong>a. Virtual Functions and Inheritance:</strong>
                        Virtual functions allow a base class to define a function that can be overridden by derived
                        classes. The appropriate
                        version of the function to be called is determined dynamically at runtime based on the actual
                        type of the object.

                 public:
                 virtual void draw() {

                    <p>
                        Runtime polymorphism allows treating objects of different derived classes as objects of the base
                        class, enabling dynamic
                        dispatch of function calls based on the actual object type.<br><br>
                        By combining compile-time polymorphism and runtime polymorphism, C++ provides powerful
                        mechanisms to achieve polymorphic
                        behavior, allowing for code reuse, extensibility, and flexibility in handling objects of
                        different types.

                    <p>
                        Polymorphism through virtual functions and inheritance is also known as runtime polymorphism or
                        dynamic polymorphism. It
                        allows objects of different derived classes to be treated as objects of the base class, enabling
                        the dynamic dispatch of
                        function calls based on the actual object type.
                    </p>
                    <strong>Here's how to achieve polymorphism through virtual functions and inheritance:</strong>
                    <pre>
                 a. Define a base class with virtual functions:
                 class Base {
                 public:
                 virtual void polymorphicFunction() {
                 // Base class implementation
                 }
                 };
                    </pre>
                    <pre>
                 b. Override the virtual functions in derived classes:
                 class Derived1 : public Base {
                 public:
                 void polymorphicFunction() override {
                 // Derived1 class implementation
                 }
                 };
                 
                 class Derived2 : public Base {
                 public:
                 void polymorphicFunction() override {
                 // Derived2 class implementation
                 }
                 };
                    </pre>
                    <pre>
                 c. Use pointers or references to the base class to achieve polymorphism:
                 int main() {
                 Derived1 derived1;
                 Derived2 derived2;
                 
                 Base* basePtr1 = & derived1;
                 Base* basePtr2 = & derived2;
                 
                 basePtr1->polymorphicFunction(); // Calls the polymorphicFunction() of Derived1
                 basePtr2->polymorphicFunction(); // Calls the polymorphicFunction() of Derived2
                 
                 return 0;
                 }
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        In the example above, the "Base" class has a virtual function "polymorphicFunction()", which is
                        overridden by the
                        derived classes "Derived1" and "Derived2". By using pointers or references of the base class
                        type, the appropriate
                        version of the function is called based on the actual object type at runtime.
                    </p>
                    <strong>2. Function Overloading:</strong>
                    <p>
                        Function overloading is a form of compile-time polymorphism that allows multiple functions with
                        the same name but
                        different parameters to be defined. The appropriate function to be called is determined based on
                        the types and number of
                        arguments at compile-time.
                    </p>
                    <strong>Here's an example of achieving polymorphism through function overloading:</strong>
                    <pre>
                 void polymorphicFunction(Base& obj) {
                 // Function implementation for Base objects

                 void polymorphicFunction(Derived1& obj) {
                 // Function implementation for Derived1 objects
                 }
                 
                 void polymorphicFunction(Derived2& obj) {
                 // Function implementation for Derived2 objects
                 }
                 
                 int main() {
                 Base baseObj;
                 Derived1 derived1Obj;
                 Derived2 derived2Obj;
                 
                 polymorphicFunction(baseObj); // Calls the function for Base objects
                 polymorphicFunction(derived1Obj); // Calls the function for Derived1 objects
                 polymorphicFunction(derived2Obj); // Calls the function for Derived2 objects
                 
                 return 0;
                 }
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        In the example above, multiple overloaded versions of the "polymorphicFunction()" are defined,
                        each accepting a
                        different type of object. The appropriate function is called based on the static type of the
                        object at compile-time.<br><br>
                        Both virtual functions and function overloading provide different forms of polymorphism in C++,
                        allowing for code reuse
                        and flexibility in handling objects of different types. The choice between these methods depends
                        on the specific
                        requirements and design of your application.

                        function arguments, and the
                        function can treat those objects uniformly through a common interface. This allows the function
                        to operate on different
                        types of objects without having to know their specific types.<br><br>

                        functions or templates.
                    </p>
                    <strong>1. Polymorphism by Inheritance and Virtual Functions:</strong>
                    <p>
                        This approach involves defining a base class with virtual functions and deriving multiple
                        classes from it. The function
                        can accept a parameter of the base class type or a reference/pointer to the base class type. The
                        appropriate version of
                        the virtual function will be called based on the actual type of the object.
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                 Example:
                 class Shape {
                 public:
                 virtual void draw() {
                 // Base class implementation
                 }
                 };
                 
                 class Circle : public Shape {
                 public:
                 void draw() override {
                 // Circle-specific implementation
                 }
                 };
                 
                 class Square : public Shape {
                 public:
                 void draw() override {
                 // Square-specific implementation
                 }
                 };
                 
                 void drawShape(const Shape& shape) {
                 shape.draw(); // Calls the appropriate draw() implementation based on the actual object type
                 }
                 
                 int main() {
                 Circle circle;
                 Square square;
                 
                 drawShape(circle); // Calls the draw() function of Circle
                 drawShape(square); // Calls the draw() function of Square
                 
                 return 0;
                 }
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        In this example, the "drawShape()" function accepts a parameter of the base class "Shape". It
                        can receive objects of
                        derived classes ("Circle" and "Square") as arguments. The appropriate "draw()" function
                        implementation is called based
                        on the actual object type at runtime.
                    </p>
                    <strong>2. Polymorphism by Templates:</strong>
                    <p>
                        Templates provide a way to achieve polymorphism by parameterizing types. A function or a class
                        can be defined using a
                        template parameter, which can represent different types. When the function is called with
                        different types, the compiler
                        generates specialized versions of the function for each specific type.
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                 Example: 
                 template< typename T>
                 void print(const T& value) {
                   std::cout << value << std::endl;
                 }
             
                 int main() {
                   int intValue = 10;
                   double doubleValue = 3.14;
                   std::string stringValue = "Hello";
                
                   print(intValue);// Calls the specialized version of print() for int
                   print(doubleValue);// Calls the specialized version of print() for double
                   print(stringValue);// Calls the specialized version of print() for std::string
                
                   return 0;
                 }
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        In this example, the "print()" function is a template function that can handle different types
                        ("int", "double",
                        "std::string") as a parameter. The compiler generates specialized versions of the function for
                        each specific type,
                        allowing polymorphic behavior.<br><br>
                        Polymorphism by parameter allows for code flexibility and reusability, enabling functions to
                        operate on different types
                        of objects through a common interface. The choice between using inheritance and virtual
                        functions or templates depends
                        on the specific requirements and design of your application.

                    <p>
                        Operator overloading in C++ allows you to define how an operator should behave when applied to
                        objects of a specific class. It enables you to provide custom implementations for the built-in
                        operators such as arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), comparison operators (==, !=, <,>, etc.),
                            and more.<br><br>
                            Operator overloading is achieved by defining a member function or a non-member function with
                            a special name and syntax corresponding to the operator being overloaded.
                    </p>
                    <strong>Here are a few examples of operator overloading in C++:</strong>
                    <strong>1. Overloading Arithmetic Operators:</strong>
                    <pre>
                 class Vector {
                 private:

                 return 0;
                 }
                    </pre>
                    <strong>3. Overloading Stream Insertion and Extraction Operators:</strong>
                    <pre>
                 class Point {
                 private:

                        These are just a few examples, and many other operators can be overloaded in C++. It's important
                        to note that not all
                        operators can be overloaded (e.g., "." and "::"). Additionally, operator overloading should be
                        used judiciously and with
                        care to maintain clarity and avoid unexpected behavior.

                    <p>
                        Parametric polymorphism, also known as generic programming, in C++ is achieved through the use
                        of templates. Templates
                        allow you to define generic classes and functions that can operate on different types without
                        the need to specify them
                        explicitly.<br><br>
                        Parametric polymorphism allows you to write reusable code that can work with different types,
                        providing flexibility and
                        code efficiency.
                    </p>
                    <strong>Here's an example of parametric polymorphism in C++ using templates:</strong>
                    <pre>
                 // Generic function to find the maximum of two values
                 template< typename T>
                 T maximum(T a, T b) {
                 return (a > b) ? a : b;
                 }
                 
                 int main() {
                 int intResult = maximum(5, 10); // Calls maximum< int>(5, 10), returns 10
                 double doubleResult = maximum(3.14, 2.71); // Calls maximum< double>(3.14, 2.71), returns 3.14
                 return 0;
                 }
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        In the example above, the "maximum()" function is a template function that takes two arguments
                        of type "T" and returns
                        the maximum value. The type "T" is a placeholder for the actual type that will be determined
                        when the function is
                        called.<br><br>
                        By calling "maximum(5, 10)", the compiler automatically deduces the type "int" for "T", and
                        "maximum< int>(5, 10)" is
                            invoked, returning the maximum of the two integers.<br><br>
                            Similarly, when "maximum(3.14, 2.71)" is called, the type "double" is deduced for "T", and
                            "maximum< double>(3.14,
                                2.71)" is invoked, returning the maximum of the two doubles.<br><br>
                                Templates provide a powerful mechanism for achieving parametric polymorphism in C++,
                                enabling code reuse and
                                flexibility in working with different types.

                        In C++, generic functions can be implemented using templates. Templates allow you to write

                        arguments of type "T&" (reference to type "T") and swaps their values. The type "T" is a

                            (int1, int2)" is invoked, swapping the values of the two integers.<br><br>
                            Similarly, when "swapValues(double1, double2)" is called, the type "double" is deduced for

                        different types of data.
                    </p>
                    <strong>Here's an example of a template function in C++:</strong>
                    <pre>
                 template< typename T>
                 add(T a, T b) {
                 return a + b;
                 }
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        In this example, "add()" is a template function that takes two arguments of type "T" and returns
                        their sum. The
                        "typename T" specifies a template parameter named "T", which represents a generic type. When the
                        function is called, the
                        compiler generates a specific version of the function for the actual types used.
                    </p>
                    <strong>Here's how you can use the template function:</strong>
                    <pre>
                 int main() {
                 int result1 = add(5, 10); // Calls add<int>(5, 10), returns 15
                 double result2 = add(3.14, 2.71); // Calls add<double>(3.14, 2.71), returns 5.85
                 
                 return 0;
                 }
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        In the "main()" function, the "add()" function is called with different types ("int" and
                        "double"). The compiler
                        automatically deduces the template argument "T" based on the provided arguments and generates
                        the appropriate
                        specialized version of the function.<br><br>
                        The template function allows you to write generic code that can handle various types without
                        having to write separate
                        functions for each type. It provides code reusability and flexibility in handling different data
                        types in C++.

                        <strong>Function name overloading:-</strong>
                    </h5>
                    <p>
                        Function name overloading in C++ refers to the ability to define multiple functions with the
                        same name but different
                        parameter lists. When calling an overloaded function, the compiler determines which version of
                        the function to invoke
                        based on the arguments provided.
                    </p>
                    <strong>Here's an example of function name overloading in C++:</strong>
                    <pre>
                 #include < iostream>
            
                 // Function to add two integers
                 int add(int a, int b) {
                 return a + b;
                 }
            
                 // Function to add three integers
                 int add(int a, int b, int c) {
                 return a + b + c;
                 }
            
                 // Function to concatenate two strings
                 std::string add(const std::string& str1, const std::string& str2) {
                 return str1 + str2;
                 }
            
                 int main() {
                 int result1 = add(5, 10); // Calls add(int, int), returns 15
                 int result2 = add(3, 6, 9); // Calls add(int, int, int), returns 18
                 std::string result3 = add("Hello, ", "world!"); // Calls add(const std::string&, const std::string&), returns
                 "Hello, world!"
            
                 std::cout << result1 << std::endl; std::cout << result2 << std::endl; std::cout << result3 << std::endl; return 0; }
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        In this example, the "add()" function is overloaded three times. The first version takes two
                        integers and returns their
                        sum, the second version takes three integers and returns their sum, and the third version takes
                        two strings and
                        concatenates them.<br><br>
                        When calling "add()", the compiler matches the provided arguments with the appropriate function
                        version based on the
                        number and types of the arguments. In the "main()" function, "add(5, 10)" calls the two-integer
                        version, "add(3, 6, 9)"
                        calls the three-integer version, and "add("Hello, ", "world!")" calls the string concatenation
                        version.<br><br>
                        Function name overloading allows you to create more expressive and intuitive interfaces for
                        functions that perform
                        similar operations but with different parameter requirements. It provides flexibility and
                        convenience when working with
                        functions in C++.

                    <p>
                        Overriding a method in C++ involves providing a new implementation of a base class method in a
                        derived class. It allows
                        the derived class to define its own behavior for the method while still preserving the
                        polymorphic behavior of the base
                        class.
                    </p>
                    <strong>Here's an example that demonstrates method overriding in C++:</strong>

                 #include < iostream>
                        
                 // Base class
                 class Shape {
                 public:
                 virtual void draw() {
                 std::cout << "Drawing a shape." << std::endl; } }; 
                 // Derived class 
                 class Circle : public Shape { 
                 public: 
                 void draw() override { 
                 std::cout << "Drawing a circle." << std::endl; 
                 }
                 }; 

                 int main() { 
                 Shape* shapePtr=new Circle();
                 shapePtr->draw(); // Calls the draw() method of the Circle class
                        
                 delete shapePtr;
                        
                 return 0;

                    <p>
                        In this example, the "Shape" class is a base class with a virtual "draw()" method. The "Circle"
                        class is derived from
                        "Shape" and overrides the "draw()" method with its own implementation.<br><br>
                        In the "main()" function, we create a pointer "shapePtr" of type "Shape*" that points to an
                        instance of the "Circle"
                        class. When "shapePtr->draw()" is called, the overridden "draw()" method of the "Circle" class
                        is invoked, which outputs
                        "Drawing a circle." instead of the base class implementation.<br><br>
                        The "override" keyword is used to indicate explicit method overriding. It helps catch errors at
                        compile-time if the
                        method being overridden does not exist in the base class.<br><br>
                        Method overriding allows derived classes to provide specialized implementations of base class
                        methods, enabling
                        polymorphism and runtime determination of the appropriate method to call based on the actual
                        object type.

                        Runtime polymorphism in C++ is achieved through a combination of virtual functions and
                        pointers/references to base class
                        objects. It allows you to invoke derived class methods through a base class pointer or
                        reference, enabling dynamic
                        binding and late binding.

                 Shape* shapePtr=new Circle();
                 shapePtr->draw(); // Calls the overridden draw() method of the Circle class

                        In this example, the "Shape" class is a base class with a virtual "draw()" method. The "Circle"
                        class is derived from
                        "Shape" and overrides the "draw()" method with its own implementation.<br><br>
                        In the "main()" function, we create a pointer "shapePtr" of type "Shape*" that points to an
                        instance of the "Circle"
                        class. When "shapePtr->draw()" is called, the overridden "draw()" method of the "Circle" class
                        is invoked due to virtual
                        dispatch.<br><br>
                        This is runtime polymorphism, as the actual implementation of the "draw()" method is
                        determined at runtime
                        based on the type of the object pointed to by the base class pointer.<br><br>
                        By using virtual functions and base class pointers/references, C++ allows dynamic binding and
                        enables polymorphic
                        behavior. This means that the appropriate method implementation is determined at runtime based
                        on the actual type of the
                        object being referred to, rather than the type of the pointer/reference.

                        <strong>Using multiple inheritance:-</strong>

                    <p>
                        In C++, multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from multiple base classes. This means
                        that a derived class can
                        inherit characteristics and behaviors from multiple parent classes, combining their features
                        into a single class.
                    </p>
                    <strong>Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of multiple inheritance in C++:</strong>
                    <pre>
                 #include < iostream>
                        
                 // First base class
                 class Shape {
                 public:
                 void displayShape() {
                 std::cout << "Shape" << std::endl; 
                 } 
                 }; // Second base class 
                 class Color { 
                 public: 
                 void displayColor() { 
                 std::cout << "Color" << std::endl; 
                 } 
                 }; // Derived class inheriting from both Shape and Color 
                 class Square : public Shape, public Color { 
                 public: 
                 void displaySquare() { 
                 std::cout << "Square" << std::endl; 
                 } 
                 }; 
                 
                 int main() { 
                 Square  square; 
                 square.displayShape(); // Accesses the displayShape() method from the Shape base class
                 square.displayColor(); // Accesses the displayColor() method from the Color base class 
                 square.displaySquare(); // Accesses the displaySquare() method from the Square derived class return 0; }
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        In this example, the "Shape" class represents a shape, and the "Color" class represents a color.
                        The "Square" class is
                        derived from both "Shape" and "Color" using multiple inheritance.<br><br>
                        The "Square" class inherits the "displayShape()" method from the "Shape" base class and the
                        "displayColor()" method from
                        the "Color" base class. It also defines its own method "displaySquare()".<br><br>
                        In the "main()" function, an instance of the "Square" class is created, and the inherited and
                        derived methods are
                        called. The "square.displayShape()" and "square.displayColor()" statements access the methods
                        inherited from the base
                        classes, while "square.displaySquare()" accesses the method specific to the "Square" derived
                        class.<br><br>
                        Multiple inheritance allows a class to acquire properties and behaviors from multiple base
                        classes, providing
                        flexibility and code reuse. However, it requires careful consideration of potential ambiguities
                        and the design of the
                        class hierarchy to ensure proper usage and avoid conflicts.

                        <strong>Persistant objects:-</strong>
                    </h5>
                    <p>
                        In C++, objects are typically stored in memory and exist only for the duration of their lifetime
                        within the program's
                        execution. However, if you want to create persistent objects that can be saved to a storage
                        medium such as a file and
                        loaded back into memory later, you would need to implement persistence mechanisms.<br><br>
                        Persistence is the ability to store and retrieve objects and their state from a non-volatile
                        storage medium. It allows
                        objects to survive beyond the execution of a program.
                    </p>
                    <strong>There are several ways to implement persistence in C++, such as:</strong>
                    <p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Serialization: Serialization involves converting objects into a stream of bytes that can
                            be saved to a file or
                            transferred over a network. The serialized data can then be deserialized to reconstruct the
                            objects later. C++ provides
                            libraries like Boost.Serialization and Protocol Buffers that facilitate serialization and
                            deserialization of objects.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Database: Storing objects in a relational or non-relational database allows for persistent
                            storage. You can use database
                            libraries like SQLite, MySQL, or MongoDB to store and retrieve objects from a database.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            File I/O: You can manually write object data to a file using file input/output operations
                            ("std::ifstream" and
                            "std::ofstream"). You would need to define your own file format and implement the logic to
                            read and write object data
                            from/to the file.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Object-relational mapping (ORM) frameworks: ORM frameworks like Hibernate (for C++) or
                            ObjectBox provide higher-level
                            abstractions for persisting objects to databases. They map objects to database tables and
                            handle object persistence
                            transparently.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The choice of persistence mechanism depends on your specific requirements and the complexity of
                        the objects you need to
                        persist. Serialization is a common and flexible approach for persisting objects, while databases
                        offer more advanced
                        querying and indexing capabilities. File I/O provides a basic approach but requires more manual
                        handling of object data.<br><br>
                        It's important to note that persistent objects may require additional considerations, such as
                        versioning, data
                        integrity, and data migration when evolving object schemas over time.

                    <strong>Streams and files:-</strong>
                    <p>
                        In C++, streams and file I/O are used to read from and write to files. The "< iostream>" and "
                            < fstream>" header files provide the necessary classes and functions for working with
                                streams
                                and files.

                        In this example, an output file stream ("std::ofstream") is created using the file name
                        "example.txt". The file is opened for writing using the "<<" operator to write the
                            string "Hello, World!" to the file. The file is then closed using the "close()"
                            function.<br><br>
                            Next, an input file stream ("std::ifstream") is created with the same file name to read from
                            the file. The file is
                            opened for reading, and the "std::getline()" function is used to read the file line by line.
                            Each line is then displayed on the console. Finally, the file is closed using the "close()"
                            function.<br><br>
                            Streams and file I/O provide a convenient and flexible way to work with files in
                            C++. They allow you to read and write data to files, perform formatted input/output, and
                            handle various data types. You can use different stream classes ("std::ifstream",
                            "std::ofstream", "std::fstream") depending on whether you need input, output, or both.

                    <p>
                        In C++, namespaces are used to organize and avoid naming conflicts in the code. A namespace is a
                        named scope that
                        contains a set of identifiers (such as variables, functions, classes, etc.) to provide a logical
                        grouping of related
                        entities.

                    <p>
                        In this example, a namespace named "MyNamespace" is defined. It contains an integer variable "x"
                        and a function
                        "printX()" that prints the value of "x". The "::" scope resolution operator is used to access
                        the global "x" variable
                        and the members of the "MyNamespace" namespace.<br><br>
                        In the "main()" function, we access the global "x" using the "::" operator. Then, we call the
                        "printX()" function and
                        access the "x" variable within the "MyNamespace" namespace using the "MyNamespace::"
                        prefix.<br><br>
                        Namespaces provide a way to organize code and avoid naming conflicts when multiple libraries or
                        modules are used
                        together. They help create a separate scope for identifiers and make the code more readable and
                        maintainable. They can
                        also be nested, allowing for hierarchical organization of entities.<br><br>
                        You can use namespaces from the standard library (e.g., "std") or define your own custom
                        namespaces to group related
                        code together and avoid naming clashes with other code elements.

                 result = divide(dividend, divisor);
                 std::cout << "Result: " << result << std::endl; 

                 } catch (const std::exception& e) { 
                 std::cerr<< "Exception caught: " << e.what() << std::endl; 

                 } 
                 return 0;

                    <P>
                        In this example, the "divide()" function is defined to perform division between two doubles. If
                        the divisor is zero, it
                        throws a "std::runtime_error" exception with a custom error message.<br><br>
                        In the "main()" function, we call "divide()" with a divisor of 0.0 inside a "try" block. If an
                        exception is thrown, it
                        is caught in the "catch" block. The "catch" block takes a reference to a "std::exception"
                        object, allowing us to access
                        the exception's information via the "what()" member function. The error message is printed to
                        the standard error stream
                        ("std::cerr").<br><br>
                        By using exception handling, you can gracefully handle exceptional cases and take appropriate
                        actions, such as
                        displaying an error message, logging, or performing recovery operations. The "catch" block can
                        be used to catch specific
                        types of exceptions or catch all exceptions using "catch (...)" to handle unexpected
                        errors.<br><br>
                        C++ provides a range of standard exception classes (e.g., "std::runtime_error",
                        "std::logic_error") that can be used or
                        you can create custom exception classes by deriving from "std::exception" or its
                        subclasses.<br><br>
                        Remember to handle exceptions appropriately and ensure proper resource management, such as
                        cleaning up allocated memory
                        or releasing acquired resources, in "catch" blocks or with the help of RAII (Resource
                        Acquisition Is Initialization)
                        techniques.

                        <strong>Generic classes:-</strong>
                    </h5>
                    <p>
                        In C++, a generic class is a class that can work with different data types without having to be
                        rewritten for each
                        specific type. It allows you to define classes that are parameterized by one or more types,
                        providing flexibility and
                        code reuse.<br><br>
                        C++ achieves generic programming through templates. Templates are used to define generic
                        classes, functions, or even
                        variables. When a template is instantiated with a specific type or set of types, it generates
                        the necessary code for
                        that specific type.
                    </p>
                    <strong>Here's an example of a generic class in C++:</strong>
                    <pre>
                 template < typename T>
                 class Stack {
                 private:
                 T* elements; // Dynamic array to store elements
                 int size; // Current size of the stack
                 int capacity; // Maximum capacity of the stack
                        
                 public:
                 Stack(int capacity) : size(0), capacity(capacity) {
                 elements = new T[capacity];
                 }
                        
                 ~Stack() {
                 delete[] elements;
                 }
                        
                 void push(const T& value) {
                 if (size < capacity) { elements[size++]=value; } } T pop() { if (size> 0) {
                 return elements[--size];
                 } else {
                 // Handle underflow condition
                 throw std::runtime_error("Stack is empty.");
                 }
                 }
                    
                 int getSize() const {
                 return size;
                 }
                 };
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        In this example, the "Stack" class is a generic class that can work with any data type "T". It
                        has a constructor,
                        destructor, push, pop, and getSize methods. The type "T" is used throughout the class to define
                        the type of the dynamic
                        array "elements" and the type of the value being pushed or popped.
                    </p>
                    <strong>
                        To use this generic class with a specific type, you instantiate it with the desired
                        type:
                    </strong>
                    <pre>
                 Stack<int> intStack(10); // Instantiate a stack of integers
             
                 intStack.push(5);
                 intStack.push(10);
                 intStack.push(15);
             
                 std::cout << "Size of intStack: " << intStack.getSize() << std::endl; 
                 int poppedValue=intStack.pop(); 
                 std::cout<< "Popped value: " << poppedValue << std::endl;
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        In this example, we instantiated the "Stack" class with the "int" type and used it to create an
                        integer stack. The class
                        behaves as if it were specifically designed for integers, but the same generic class can be
                        instantiated with other
                        types, such as "double", "std::string", or even custom types.

                        The Standard Template Library (STL) is a powerful library in C++ that provides a collection of
                        generic algorithms and
                        data structures. It is part of the C++ Standard Library and is included with all compliant C++
                        compilers.
                    </p>
                    <strong>The STL consists of several components, including:</strong>
                    <p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            **Containers**: Containers are data structures that store objects or values. The STL
                            provides various container classes,
                            such as "vector", "list", "deque", "set", "map", and more. These containers offer different
                            characteristics in terms of
                            storage, access, and insertion/deletion efficiency.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            **Algorithms**: The STL provides a rich set of algorithms that can be used on containers or
                            other data structures.
                            Algorithms include operations like sorting, searching, modifying, and iterating over
                            elements. Some commonly used
                            algorithms are "sort", "find", "transform", "accumulate", and many more.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            **Iterators**: Iterators provide a way to access and traverse elements in a container.
                            They act as generalized
                            pointers that can be used to move through the elements of a container, regardless of the
                            specific container type.
                            Iterators allow algorithms to be applied uniformly to different containers.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            **Function objects**: Function objects, also known as functors, are objects that act like
                            functions. They can be used
                            with algorithms to customize their behavior. Functors are often used for sorting, searching,
                            and other operations that
                            require custom comparisons or transformations.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            **Allocators**: Allocators provide a way to manage the memory allocation and deallocation of
                            objects stored in
                            containers. They allow customization of memory management strategies and provide an
                            interface for allocating and
                            releasing memory.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The STL components work together to provide a powerful framework for generic programming in C++.
                        You can use the
                        containers to store data, apply algorithms to manipulate or analyze the data, and utilize
                        iterators to access the
                        elements. The STL promotes code reuse, efficiency, and flexibility by providing a consistent and
                        well-designed set of
                        tools for common programming tasks.
                    </p>
                    <strong>Here's a simple example that demonstrates the usage of the STL:</strong>
                    <pre>
                 #include < iostream>
                 #include < vector>
                 #include < algorithm>
                 
                 int main() {
                 std::vector<int> numbers = {5, 2, 8, 3, 1};
    
                 // Sort the numbers
                 std::sort(numbers.begin(), numbers.end());

                 // Print the sorted numbers
                 for (const auto& num : numbers) {
                 std::cout << num << " " ; 
                 } 
                 
                 std::cout << std::endl; 
                 // Find the minimum and maximum element 
                 int minNum=*std::min_element(numbers.begin(), numbers.end()); 
                 int maxNum=*std::max_element(numbers.begin(), numbers.end()); 
                 std::cout << "Min: " << minNum << std::endl; 
                 std::cout << "Max: " << maxNum << std::endl; 
                 return 0; 
                 }
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        In this example, we include the necessary headers ("< iostream>", "< vector>", "< algorithm>")
                                    to
                                    use the STL components.
                                    We create a "vector" of integers, populate it with values, and then use the "sort"
                                    algorithm to sort the
                                    numbers in ascending order. Finally, we use "min_element" and "max_element"
                                    algorithms to find the minimum
                                    and maximum values in the vector.

                    <p>
                        In C++, libraries are organized into headers and implementation files. The headers contain
                        declarations of classes,
                        functions, and other entities, while the implementation files (.cpp files) contain the
                        definitions of those entities.
                        This separation allows for modular code organization and helps with compilation
                        efficiency.<br><br>
                        When it comes to containers in C++, they are part of the Standard Template Library (STL), which
                        is a collection of
                        generic algorithms and data structures provided by the C++ Standard Library. Containers in the
                        STL provide different
                        ways to store and organize data.
                    </p>
                    <strong>Here are some commonly used containers in C++:</strong>
                    <p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            **Vector**: "std::vector" is a dynamic array that can resize itself automatically as
                            elements are added or removed. It
                            provides random access to elements and is efficient for appending and accessing elements at
                            the end. Insertions and
                            deletions at arbitrary positions are slower compared to the end.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            **List**: "std::list" is a doubly-linked list. It allows efficient insertions and deletions
                            at any position, but random
                            access to elements is slower compared to vectors and arrays.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            **Deque**: "std::deque" (short for double-ended queue) is similar to a vector but allows
                            efficient insertions and
                            deletions at both ends. It provides random access to elements as well.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            **Queue**: "std::queue" is a container adapter that provides a FIFO (First-In-First-Out)
                            data structure. It is typically
                            implemented using a deque or a list.

                        These are just a few examples of containers available in the C++ Standard Library. Each
                        container has its own
                        characteristics in terms of performance, memory usage, and operations supported. The choice of
                        container depends on the
                        specific requirements of your program, such as the type of operations needed, the expected size
                        of the data, and the
                        performance constraints.<br><br>
                        To use these containers, you need to include the appropriate header file (e.g., "< vector>", "
                            < list>", "< queue>") and
                                    then create objects of the corresponding container class. You can then use the
                                    member functions provided by
                                    the container class to manipulate and access the data stored within the container
                    </p>
                    <strong>
                        For example, to use a vector, you would include the "< vector>" header and create a vector
                            object like this:
                    </strong>
                    <pre>
                 #include < vector>

                 std::vector< int> numbers; // Create an empty vector of integers
            
                 numbers.push_back(5); // Add elements to the vector
                 numbers.push_back(2);
                 numbers.push_back(8);
            
                 int element = numbers[1]; // Access an element using the subscript operator
            
                 return 0;
                 }

                    <p>
                        In this example, we create a vector of integers, add elements to it using the "push_back"
                        function, and access an
                        element using the subscript operator "[ ]".

                        <strong>Iterators and allocators:-</strong>
                    </h5>
                    <p>
                        In C++, iterators and allocators are additional components provided by the Standard Template
                        Library (STL) that work in
                        conjunction with containers and algorithms.
                    </p>
                    <strong>1. **Iterators**:</strong>
                    <p>
                        Iterators provide a way to traverse and access elements within a container or a range of data.
                        They act as generalized
                        pointers and allow algorithms to operate on different containers uniformly. Iterators abstract
                        the concept of iteration
                        and provide a consistent interface for accessing elements.
                    </p>
                    <strong>There are several types of iterators in C++, including:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            - **Input Iterators**: These iterators allow reading elements from a container in a
                            forward-only manner. They support
                            operations like dereferencing ("*it"), incrementing ("++it"), and comparing for equality
                            ("it == end").
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            - **Output Iterators**: These iterators allow writing elements to a container in a
                            forward-only manner. They support
                            operations like dereferencing and incrementing, but they may have limited functionality
                            compared to other iterators.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            **Forward Iterators**: These iterators combine the functionality of both input and output
                            iterators, allowing reading and writing elements in a forward-only manner.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            **Bidirectional Iterators**: These iterators support operations in both forward and backward
                            directions. They can be
                            incremented and decremented.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            **Random Access Iterators**: These iterators provide full functionality for random access,
                            allowing efficient element access, arithmetic operations ("it + n", "it - n"), and
                            comparison operations ("it1 < it2"). </li>
                    </ul>
                    <P>
                        Iterators are commonly used with algorithms to iterate over elements in a container, perform
                        operations, and access or
                        modify the data. They provide a level of abstraction and enable generic programming.
                    </P>
                    <strong>2. **Allocators**:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Allocators are used to manage the memory allocation and deallocation of objects within
                            containers. They provide an
                            interface for allocating, constructing, and releasing memory for elements stored in
                            containers. Allocators abstract the
                            process of memory management and allow customization of memory allocation strategies.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Containers in the STL are parameterized by an allocator type. By default, they use a
                            specific allocator
                            ("std::allocator") that provides a basic memory allocation mechanism using "new" and
                            "delete" operators. However, custom
                            allocator types can be provided to containers for specialized memory management needs.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Allocators define member functions such as "allocate", "deallocate", "construct", and
                            "destroy" to manage memory. The
                            allocator is responsible for allocating memory for elements, constructing objects within
                            that memory, releasing memory
                            when objects are destroyed, and deallocating memory.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Using allocators allows you to control the memory allocation behavior of containers and
                            adapt them to specific
                            requirements, such as using custom memory pools or specialized memory management techniques.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            While iterators and allocators are advanced features of the STL, they provide additional
                            flexibility and customization
                            options when working with containers and algorithms. They enable efficient iteration and
                            memory management, making the
                            STL a powerful library for generic programming in C++.
                        </li>

                    <p>
                        In C++, strings are a sequence of characters stored as objects. They are part of the Standard
                        Template Library (STL) and
                        provide a convenient way to work with text and manipulate strings of characters. Here are some
                        key points about strings
                        in C++:
                    </p>
                    <strong>1. **Definition and Initialization**:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Strings are represented by the "std::string" class in C++.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            To use strings, you need to include the "< string>" header.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Strings can be initialized using literals, other strings, or character arrays.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <strong>2. **Operations on Strings**:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Concatenation: Strings can be concatenated using the "+" operator or the "append()"
                            function.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Accessing Characters: Individual characters in a string can be accessed using the subscript
                            operator "[ ]" or the "at()"
                            member function.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Length: The "length()" or "size()" member functions return the length of a string.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Substring: The "substr()" function allows extracting a portion of a string.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Comparison: Strings can be compared using operators like "==", "!=", "<", ">" , etc. </li>
                        <li>
                            Searching and Modifying: Functions like "find()", "replace()", and "erase()" provide search
                            and modification
                            capabilities.

                        <li>
                            Conversion: Strings can be converted to C-style character arrays using the "c_str()" member
                            function.
                        </li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Strings can be read from and written to standard input/output streams using the ">>" and "
                            <<" operators, respectively. </li>
                        <li>
                            They can also be formatted using stream manipulators and formatting options.

                    <strong>4. **Dynamic Memory Allocation**:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Strings manage their memory dynamically, so you don't need to worry about manually
                            allocating or deallocating memory.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The "std::string" class handles memory management internally.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <strong>**String Manipulation Efficiency**:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Strings provide efficient concatenation and appending operations.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            However, due to the dynamic nature of strings, some operations like inserting or deleting
                            characters in the middle may
                            have a higher time complexity compared to fixed-size character arrays.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Strings in C++ provide a higher level of abstraction compared to character arrays, making them
                        more convenient and
                        flexible for working with textual data. They offer a wide range of operations, including
                        concatenation, searching,
                        modification, and input/output functionalities. The "std::string" class handles memory
                        management, simplifying string
                        manipulation and ensuring proper memory allocation.

                        <li>
                            Streams are implemented as classes in C++. The primary stream classes are "std::istream" for
                            input (e.g., "std::cin")
                            and "std::ostream" for output (e.g., "std::cout").

                        <li>
                            Streams provide insertion ("<<") and extraction (">>") operators to perform formatted input

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The insertion operator ("<<") is used to write data to an output stream, and the extraction
                                operator (">>") is used to
                                read data from an input stream.

                        Streams in C++ provide a flexible and unified way to handle input and output operations. They
                        can be used to read from
                        and write to different sources, including the console, files, and strings. With formatting
                        options, stream state
                        management, and buffering mechanisms, streams offer powerful and customizable I/O capabilities

                    <p>
                        In C++, manipulators are special functions or objects that modify the behavior of streams during
                        input/output (I/O)
                        operations. They provide a flexible and convenient way to control formatting, change stream
                        state, set flags, or perform
                        other operations on streams. Manipulators can be used with input streams ("std::istream") and
                        output streams
                        ("std::ostream") to customize the I/O behavior.

                            The object can store additional state or configuration information for custom manipulations.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                        User-defined manipulators allow programmers to extend the functionality of streams in C++. They
                        provide a means to
                        encapsulate custom formatting, state modifications, or other operations specific to the
                        application's requirements. By
                        creating user-defined manipulators, programmers can achieve greater control and flexibility in
                        stream-based I/O
                        operations.

                        <strong>Vectors:-</strong>
                    </h5>
                    <p>
                        In C++, vectors are a dynamic array-like data structure provided by the Standard Template
                        Library (STL). They are part
                        of the container classes in C++ and offer a convenient way to store and manipulate a sequence of
                        elements. Here are some
                        key points about vectors in C++:
                    </p>
                    <strong>1. **Definition and Initialization**:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Vectors are represented by the "std::vector" class in C++.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            To use vectors, you need to include the "<vector>" header.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Vectors can store elements of any type, including built-in types and user-defined types.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Vectors can be initialized using various methods, such as assignment, initializer lists, or
                            by specifying the size and
                            initial values.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <strong>2. **Dynamic Size**:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Vectors automatically manage their size, allowing for dynamic resizing as elements are added
                            or removed.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Elements can be added to a vector using the "push_back()" member function, which appends the
                            element to the end of the
                            vector.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Vectors can also be resized explicitly using the "resize()" member function.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <strong>3. **Random Access**:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Vectors support random access to elements, meaning you can directly access elements at any
                            position using the subscript
                            operator "[]".
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Elements can be accessed, modified, or assigned using the subscript operator.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <strong>4. **Container Operations**:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Vectors provide various member functions for common container operations, such as inserting
                            elements, erasing elements,
                            and clearing the vector.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Common member functions include "insert()", "erase()", "clear()", "size()", "empty()", and
                            more.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <strong>5. **Efficient Element Access**:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Vectors offer efficient element access due to their underlying contiguous memory layout.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Iterators can be used to traverse the vector and access elements using algorithms or in
                            range-based loops.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Vectors in C++ provide a flexible and efficient way to store and manipulate collections of
                        elements. They offer dynamic
                        resizing, random access, and a rich set of member functions for common container operations.
                        Vectors are commonly used
                        when the size of the collection may change dynamically and efficient element access is required.

                        <strong>Slice:-</strong>
                    </h5>
                    <p>
                        In C++, the term "slice" typically refers to the operation of extracting a portion of a
                        container or array. It involves
                        selecting a range of elements from a sequence and creating a new container or view that
                        represents that subset. The
                        concept of slicing is not directly supported by the Standard Library in C++, but it can be
                        achieved using various
                        techniques.
                    </p>
                    <strong>Here are a few approaches to achieve slicing in C++:</strong>
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>1. **Subsequence using Iterators**:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Slicing can be accomplished by using iterators to specify the beginning and ending positions
                            of the desired range.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You can create a new container or perform operations on the selected subset of elements
                            using the iterator range.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            For example, to slice a vector "myVector" from index 2 to index 5:
                            <br>
                            std::vector< int> slicedVector(myVector.begin() + 2, myVector.begin() + 6);
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <strong>2. **std::vector::erase**:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The "std::vector::erase" function can be used to remove elements from a vector and
                            effectively create a slice.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            By specifying the iterator range to be erased, you can remove elements and modify the vector
                            in-place.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            For example, to slice a vector "myVector" from index 2 to index 5:
                            <br>
                            myVector.erase(myVector.begin() + 2, myVector.begin() + 6);
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <strong>3. **std::valarray**:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The "std::valarray" class in the Standard Library provides an alternative to slicing for
                            mathematical operations on
                            arrays.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            "std::valarray" supports mathematical operations and slicing-like functionality, such as
                            selecting a subset of elements
                            based on conditions or indices.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            For example, to slice a "std::valarray< int>" called "myValArray" from index 2 to index 5:
                                <br>
                                std::valarray< int> slicedValArray = myValArray[std::slice(2, 3, 1)];
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        It's important to note that the approaches mentioned above are just examples and may vary
                        depending on the specific
                        requirements and container types used in your code. Slicing in C++ generally involves using
                        iterators or specific member
                        functions of containers to extract a subset of elements from a sequence or modify the original
                        container accordingly.

                    <p>
                        A generalized numeric algorithm in C++ refers to a generic algorithm that operates on numeric
                        data types, such as
                        integers, floating-point numbers, or custom numeric types. These algorithms are designed to work
                        with different types of
                        numeric data, providing a flexible and reusable solution.<br><br>
                        To implement a generalized numeric algorithm in C++, you can use templates. Templates allow you
                        to write generic code
                        that can work with different data types. Here's an example of a simple generalized numeric
                        algorithm that calculates the
                        sum of a range of numbers:
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                 #include < iostream>
                 #include < numeric>
                 #include < vector>
            
                 template< typename T>
                 T calculateSum(const std::vector<T>& numbers) {
                 T sum = std::accumulate(numbers.begin(), numbers.end(), static_cast<T>(0));
                 return sum;
                 }
    
                 int main() {
                 std::vector< int> intNumbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
                 int intSum = calculateSum(intNumbers);
                 std::cout << "Sum of integers: " << intSum << std::endl; std::vector< double> doubleNumbers =
                 {1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 4.4, 5.5};
                 double doubleSum = calculateSum(doubleNumbers);
                 std::cout << "Sum of doubles: " << doubleSum << std::endl; 
                 return 0; 
                 }
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        In the example above, the "calculateSum" function is a template function that takes a vector of
                        type "T" (where "T" is a
                        placeholder for the numeric type). The function uses the "std::accumulate" algorithm from the "
                        < numeric>" library to
                            calculate the sum of the numbers in the vector. The "static_cast< T>(0)" is used to provide
                                the initial value for the
                                sum, ensuring it matches the type of the numeric data.<br><br>
                                In the "main" function, we demonstrate the usage of the "calculateSum" function with
                                both integer and double
                                vectors. The function is instantiated with the appropriate types based on the argument
                                passed, allowing it to
                                work correctly with different numeric types.<br><br>
                                You can expand upon this concept to create more complex generalized numeric algorithms
                                that operate on various
                                numeric data types.
